It stutters like crazy on my steam deck which is surprising since it's only a 1.5 GB game. Also and the onus is on me for this one since I bought day one, but the controls on gamepad/deck is wishy-washy at best there isn't even an option to recalibrate controls. Maybe wait it out until the dev updates again. but for now I can't recommend.",0

You cannot get past the character creation if you want to play on the free server which will only let you play to a certain point, then you have to pay. They want a subscription for a game that looks 20 years old with worse controls than that (no diagonal movement). It sounded like a good game before, but is extremely poorly programmed/executed and has no chance with greedy developers.",0
137774101,1294810,"So this was a tough pill to swallow.  On one hand I look at the game and see good fundamentals that COULD become fun.  The way it stands right now, it is very buggy, ai is extremely sub par and the game is very poorly optimized, as I'm sure any console gamer will especially tell you on release as they only get 30fps max.    This is actually the first game Ive ever refunded in my 18 years on the platform.  I am finally at the point where if I cant enjoy the game on release, I don't want to encourage laziness from the developer, and if they need more time to make the game, an actually finished product, then they need to do that instead of rushing their half baked product out the door.  I enjoyed the first couple hours but I could already see the glaring issues at play and Id rather wait and just get the game 6 months down the line when it gets some updates and people actually want to play it",0
137773593,1294810,"Dont buy this pls, got the game for free with my Nvidia card but I still feel robbed. Slideshow cutscenes, horrible graphics, boring gameplay and no real challenge when it comes to combat. Please buy anything but this...",0

137773026,1155330,"(Asked the Devs for a key and they hooked it up)  XCOM/Mutant Year Zero + Smash TV + The Running Man (With a cool trap avoidance system too)  Great vibes, great game!",1
137772703,1155330,A good little gem of a game. If you like turned based combat similar to xcom or any other top down turned based game you will like this game. The customization is not as deep as other games similar to this but the characters and battles make up for it. For the price they are asking it is very good.,1
137772345,1155330,"PROS: The tactical shooter part of the game is really enjoyable. Robust, interesting, and satisfying. The announcer can get a bit tiresome, but it's easily turned off.  CONS: Everything else. You are forced to play a 3rd person hide and seek for all these microscopic traps between battles. And the developers seemed to have just searched their assets for ""particle effects"" ""fire"" ""blood"" and ""flashing"" and plopped down stuff as much as possible. It's like the worst kind of easter egg hunt, and makes probably half the time you have the controller in your hand, un-fun.  Same with the intermission hub. Maybe there's a good reason to have it in third person and it just hasn't made itself obvious, but coming from XCOM2, you get all the same functionality (rooms, POI's, etc) but since you have to walk from room to room it takes you 4 or 5 times as long to do anything.   I'm going to keep playing, but every time i finish a battle now, I feel like I want to stop playing because I have to spend a chunk of time playing a dumb hide and seek game with the developers.  Oh, and if you are playing Ironman, you can't save in the Hub. It autosaves when you enter, and when you leave. So if you quit the game before you activate the next mission, you have to do the entire hub sequence again.   TLDR: Great Tactical Shooter stuffed in between so many poor design decisions.",0
137770969,1155330,"The tactic part is solid and entertaining but You have to walk from one level to the next.  On the path you have to avoid traps and interact with the environment. This with incredible slow and clunky controls makes it unbelievable annoying.  I just finnished level two and my immediate thought was ""oh no, I have to walk to level three!"" -> uninstall + refund",0
137770888,1155330,A great turn based strategy and lot of brutal fun. 10/10,1
137774149,1669000,A wonderful mix of 4x and tactical combat with lots of room for emergent stories,1
137774052,1669000,"Been having a lot of fun playing the game, lots to learn and explore. This game is going to eat my time for a long time to come.",1
137774046,1669000,"I haven't played Age of Wonders 3 too much or planetfall at all, but I'm absolutely in love with this game! It reminds me of a mixture of Civ and Heroes of Might and Magic 3. If you enjoy either of those games I think you will really love this one. The core gameplay is super solid and everything feels quite polished. The only complaint I would have is that it is hard to have an identity in this game. Most games have really unique races that scream for a playthrough with each, but AoW4 gives you so much customization that it is up to you to attribute the identity to your heroes and factions. I'm not entirely sure this is a complaint however because the customization is so amazing and makes the game infinitely replayable. Lastly, I LOVE the pantheon system. Basically it's a rogue-like system where every playthrough gives you experience to unlock different rewards. I love this because at times 4x games can feel unrewarding to finish. This makes sure that you actually finish your games and encourages you to keep playing. All in all I think this is an incredibly solid title that any strategy player should check out!",1
137774042,1669000,"Its like Endless Legend and Total War had a kid with Paradox abusing it on the weekends, 10/10.",1
137773882,1669000,Just a short first impression: It is good. They went in the direction I wished they would have done earlier by adding more civillization like mechanics than the previous entries had. It immedaitely felt more motivating than AoE III which I found to be somewhat dissapointing.  The downsides so far are the little movement heroes have compared to previous entries and that the KI likes to stack a ton of troops which requires the player to do the same which is just annoying micromanagement.  I am not sure yet how I feel about the race customizations. It makes them feel kinda ... samey.  In the 7 hours I played so far I had one crash that prevented me from continuing the current game as I somehow was unable to load any of the saves of that particular match.,1

137776104,2106910,"Okay so Ive played this game a bit.   I will come out and say it, the game very fun BUT BUT BUT BUT it is SUPER grindy. I personally love grinding out stuff. The game at first is a honestly pretty frustrating but really every problem I had has been solved by grinding out Faith and upgrading stuff. I did have one problem about how they presented Corruption as a game mechanic, which they basically didnt tell you at all....which is REALLY bad because Corruption can spiral out of control really quickly and basically end your run. Once I unlocked the Monk tower on the other hand, Corruption hasn't been a problem since.  I think in the latest update the dev(s) added a tutorial moment talking about how Corruption works which is a great update.   Overall I really do like this game, I personally don't mind the grind. I loved Rogue Tower and farming all of those upgrades. I just want to be clear there is a great game here, just under some grind.",1
137775484,2128270,The UI is extremly minimalistic but well thought out. It's easier to pick up than Rift Wizard but still has enough depth. Difficulty spike is also pretty good: You wont get one shotted at the first levels and therefore can experiment early on. There are harder difficulties and other content to unlock as you progress through the game.  For everyone who enjoys experimenting with skill systems.,1
137774449,2128270,"If you want to be an unarmed, evasive Monk who punches enemies from afar with mind fists, then look no further.   Awesome broken builds simulator, with streamlined yet traditional rogue-like mechanics. Clearly a passion project by a single dev and it is filled with flavour and endless potential.",1
137776204,1277920,"Pretty good game, no level caps many professions. Has a lot to offer, they don't make good games these days and this one is actually one to check out. They had server issues at launch what MMO doesn't lol. But yea game has loads of potential. All the negative reviews are from the F2P players and server issues.",1
137775196,1673090,WhooHOO this is a good little game! nice 2D RPG with a good amount to do and skill grinding if you like that stuff. The content is worth the current price and updates are regular enough. Looking forward to some big content updates in the future to hopefully expand this game out even further!,1
137776786,1294810,I want the $0 I paid for this back.,0
137776437,1294810,"Man I was hyped for this one, now boy do I feel like a twat. Redfall? More like Dreadful lmao",0
137775130,1294810,"Redfail Bethesda should pay us to play this...  Boring World AI Dumb AF Boring Weapons & Perks No Ability Choice Weird Letters all over the place to read Alot of Bugs & Glitches Singleplayer Game forced Online Always (Losing Connection to ""ArkNet"" = Loosing Progression",0
137774731,1294810,"I'm a huge Left 4 Dead, L4D2, and Back 4 Blood fan..  Redfall was marketed as a game that could give the above titles a run for their money..  How it ended.. well, we've all seen the reviews now.. Too many bugs, graphical glitches, dated mechanics, dull quests, empty areas, and uninspired game play.   Stay away. Don't think any amount of patches will fix the inherent problems with this game.. It's just bad - was a pleasure to uninstall after 2 hours.   Got it for free as an included promo with my hardware purchase, and I wish they included literally anything else..",0
137774263,1294810,"Sort of a cross between Far Cry and Borderlands. I can't understand all the bad reviews - the game runs fine, looks good, and is enjoyable to play. There seems to be some sort of bandwagon for haters, which imho says more about humanity than it does about this game.",1
137776969,1669000,"Grew up on HoMM, got really into Civ5 ... and this game is a combo of both. There are still some balancing tweaks that could be made and the late-game feels like a slog, but the core gameplay is JUICY.  10/10 Uninstalled Civ5",1
137776748,1669000,"I have been waiting 30 years for a worthy heir to Master of Magic. And I finally found it. This hits all the right boxes. Gorgeous graphics, overland strategic world map and close up tactical combat maps. Hiring heroes, discovering ancient wonders, researching multiple tomes of magic, multiple way to win the game, summoning monsters, making friend or enemy with other wizard kings, the list go on. And it's all there!",1
137776621,1669000,Do not buy this game until the constant crashes issues are fixed.,0
137776510,1669000,I have been a AOW fan for years. This game is by far the best in the series. You can customize so much and make your own world. Great presentation. Challenging game play. In depth mechanics. I foresee many enjoyable hours with a flesh eating Elf named Marvin.,1
137776223,1669000,"Probably one of the most enjoyable 4x games that has come out recently. But I'll skip the long winded review and just list my pros and cons.   Pros:  - Customization of empires is enjoyable and unlike anything I've played in a 4x game.  - Combat is more enjoyable than most games in this genre  - The UI is great and easy to navigate  - Clearly has a lot of great foundational systems that can be built upon by mods or dlc which I look forward to  - Diplomacy works pretty well  Cons:  - The tomes that decide what your empire can research could use some more fleshing out  - Thanks to the customization most of the units can have different traits but are ultimately the same base unit across empires (Scout, Battle Mage, Support, etc.) so they make look and have couple of different spells but ultimately just that base class which makes me feel like I'm just fighting Battle Mages with different skins. - The Seafaring system is so bare bones I'd rather just play maps with no water haha.",1
137776086,1669000,"It's a pretty decent 4X game that DESPERATELY needs an AI overhaul. Alliances are practically useless as they will never actively assist you and more often than not will drag out a game because of that point, all the while constantly whinging about not having enough money and pestering you for more while they turtle more and more. Honestly, if you've got 8 armies of 6 units right at your border, why not come down the road and help?  Multiple games will absolutely expose the fact that none of the racial stuff is even remotely worthwhile, just set dressing. Not to mention the Pantheon system - really neat idea to allow you to have a record of all your victories but the unlocks are heavily weighted towards useless cosmetics - very few choices will actually lead you to anything of actual value.\  Until they fix the AI issue at least, I can't in good conscience recommend this game to someone playing single player.",0
137776069,1669000,"A unique mash of Total War Warhammer, Civ & Stellaris.  I'd never heard of this series before this entry and can say two things, I am impressively bad at the game and I love it:D",1
137775851,1669000,"The depth of customization and presumably therefore replayability in this game is insane. You really do seem to be able to make whatever kind of fantasy race you want and play pretty much however you want. I wanted to make a peaceful cat race that's masters of the elemental arts and necromancy, but seen as virtuous and good guys by all the other races in the land. I did and am. My stupid ally dragged me into a war with one of the other major factions in my match and our magical might quickly put a stop to that. Being able to phase thru objects and getting a stacking buff for each spell I cast during combat, plus being able to reanimate the fallen in battle to use them to fight for me is a fun combo. I started dabbling in making my people more frost oriented with how many spells I now have related around that including the ability to terraform provinces into frozen wastelands which would hamper my enemies but buff my people.  If there was ever a kind of fantasy race of people and/or empire you wanted to build, this game will likely let you do it. Along the way, you'll probably find plenty of other interesting combos for future matches you might want to try out. My next run around, I want to try a race that's all about damaging the Morale of my enemies. I saw a spell that gives you a 90% chance to mind control a unit that's routing from low Morale and I want that.",1
137775612,1669000,bing chilling,1
137775608,1669000,Great to play around with transformations,1
137775401,1669000,Great game. Shame it crashes to desktop in battles so often.,0
137775198,1669000,"This game is incredible.  I first played the introductory zone, and thought I had made a mistake buying this game. I felt I was clicking end turn and waiting a LOT for things to happen, and then had so much magic I didn't know what any of it did. After 2 hours, I won a military victory at 123 turns and moved on to the story.  I made a Druidic Orc faction, and boy was it fun. I also stopped rushing through the turns, started checking the spells I had, reading the tooltips, and spent 4 hours playing this making it twice as long as my first campaign zone. Despite it taking twice as long, I completed this campaign on turn 27!  This game is like Civilization, meets Heroes of Might and Magic, with the customization of Stellaris, and the spells of Total War: Warhammer.   Unlike Civ, Stellaris and Total War however, it encourages you to finish a campaign, as you get rewards, progressions that carry across to be used in new factions or races in the future. Additionally the Hero you played as, if you complete the level, can come back in future campaigns, which creates some cool storytelling moments.  The game also has a UI like Crusader Kings 3. In a good way. It has nested tooltips, cool story events and moments (which are worth reading).  This game encourages you to take your time, slow down and not rush through it. That said if you are feeling lazy, you can auto-resolve the battles, or have them auto-play out while you watch the AI control your forces. You can also change the speeds. It's a fantastic addition.  Some simple tricks and tips are: Kill all the small mobs and enemy groups that you can see. The rewards are very worth it. Always try and be at your max number of towns but don't go over. Always be at your max cap of heroes, but you can go over this if you have the extra 30 gold per turn.  I picked this game up on a whim. I had a LOT of work to get done today. It was 11 hours later that I finally put it down and went ""oh damn.."" when I realised I was going to be up until 2am doing the work that I was meant to get done earlier today.   It's the first game in a LONG time that has made me lose complete track of time entirely, whilst enjoying every minute of it.   10/10",1
137775088,1669000,I love working hard to be able to afford games that I love playing... I am not a fan of spending my money to pay for a fifteen minute experience that ends in a crash.,0
137774875,1669000,after Civilization Vl i thought there wouldnt be anymore games just like or better. Age of wonder 4 is actually enjoyable in its own way and glad its not as bad as the other new games that came out just like these kinds of games...,1
137774752,1669000,Beautiful game.,1
137774589,1669000,Simply amazing. If Endless Legend was the foundation this is the Apex.,1

137774466,1669000,"It would be nice if they focused on doing their best to assist with Proton compatibility.  The era of Windows domination for gaming may not be over, but it is definitely waning.  An otherwise fun, beautiful and engaging game.",1
137774255,1669000,its aight...,1
137776082,2362120,"A clever seek and find game with a merger twist. It was clearly made with a lot of love, and I found it very easy to get into. The quirky art style is very unique, like playing a new yorker magazine cover",1
137774696,2272420,"No controller support, normally wouldn't be an issue but the A button on my keyboard is broken and I just wanted to get playing this. Hope controller support can be added?",0

137775538,1566200,Anything hockey related on PC  needs to be checked out.  This game has a lot of potential and the road-map looks promising.,1
137774902,1566200,"Tape to Tape is a very unique game concept. As a sports fan I thought the concept of a Hockey Roguelite was worth going in blindly even though I am not a huge fan of Roguelites.  On the surface Tape to Tape is a fun little arcade hockey game that is a heavily arcade-fantasy style sports game. My personal opinion its leans too much arcade as there are literally no rules. No, icing, no off-sides, no penalties.  [b]NO OFF-SIDES.[/b] This is the biggest rule that really affects game play and strategy. After a few games you will quickly realize that off-sides in Hockey is a huge rule that adds strategy and makes the game more exciting because without it you can easily cherry pick and freely skate around the ice with the puck where ever you choose.  This one thing really soured me on the gameplay. Each match devolves into the same thing, w/o off-sides the core Hockey mechanics quickly became quit stale.  There are other minor rule issues that I can look past as an arcade hockey game but off-sides, nope.  The game features crazy reality breaking abilities like AOE farts that knock down players, throwing your stick at players to knock them down. Slapshots to the head that knock down players, freezing players in a block of ice for long periods of time.  Earlier where I said the game leans too far into the fantasy aspect, this is where it got crazy for me and not in a good way. I likes some of the stuff like throwing your stick. Once I got to the AOE fart abilities or the Ice Block or the Teleporting stuff I began to think how stupid and how unrelated this game was to actual hockey.  Its frustrating, I want to like this game but 3 hours of playing I came to the conclusion that the only thing I like about this game is that its Hockey related.  I got annoyed early on at the music and celebration animations. I came to hate the humor and art style and the ""quirky"" aspects of the game.   The core gameplay is quite bare-bones once sink your teeth into it. No stick/poke check. No deke. Checking is very poorly animated and controlled, movement feels pretty bad. You can't control the goalie while in goal. You can't manually select a player while on the ice, you can just cycle through them or hope you select the guy closest to the puck. You can't dive or kneel to block, there is no block button. There is essentially only one kind of shot, no wrist-shots. Most goals will look the same, crash the net one timers.  I think the concept has some potential but the execution isn't there. I honestly think you may like this game more if you don't give a shit about hockey but if you LOVE hockey you will see all the flaws that pile up and make this game NOT hockey at all.  This game is Early Access, maybe they can improve over time but I would avoid for now.",0
137776629,1494420,Huge potential here.  It's Arma meets StarCraft meets Savage meets Battlezone (if anyone remembers it from 1998). So far the developers have done an excellent job of creating a compelling setting with incredible visuals.  Battlefields are vast and units are really diverse requiring communication with team mates to effectively defeat enemies.  Races have obvious strengths and weaknesses that intelligent players and commanders can exploit for tactical advantages.  Teams need to carefully coordinate their defenses to avoid friendly fire.  All told a fantastic combination of FPS and RTS elements.  Looking forward to future updates!,1
137774348,1494420,"Really, REALLY good execution of the concept it's attempting for gameplay. The blend of RTS and FPS for players works VERY well together, with both sides of gameplay being relatively easy to understand and follow. Takes 1-2 attempts to learn and then you're already hitting the ground running. Also allows great co-operative gameplay between myself who prefers RTS games, and my friends, who're more on the FPS side of things. Obviously there's a lot of gameplay kinks that need to be worked out, but that's to be expected since it's not fully finished.  Graphics are great as well considering it's development state, runs smooth for every client. My only gripe is the multiplayer, can easily get laggy between players. Which I'm still looking into to see if it's my own issue or not (I usually host for my friends) or if it's from the game itself not being optimized yet.   RTS: - Feels very much like Command & Conquer, which I loved, so I felt right at home, just slower paced  FPS: - Feels a bit like CoD, just slower paced, and no grenades :P  I hope this game gets much love from the developers and becomes something great.",1
137774627,2002220,"It is a fun game. Even in this early state, you can get into the 'one more game' mood. I really like the gritty pixelart style and I think that is what made me wishlist it initially.  For now, you can see the 'alpha-ness. While it is really appealing visually, there are a lot of things I hope will change in the next steps:  UX/UI: - I think there is need of a visual-priority-concept. How does the player differentiate between enemy attacks, traps, their own attacks and allies etc - For replay value, I think it would be helpful to see more game stats post mortem. In Vampire Survivors (That comparison had to come up eventually), you can see how much damage which attack did os you can evolve your gameplay accordingly. - The connection between upgrade-icons and attacks isn't reallly comprehensible for me. A lot of icons look really similar, which makes it harder to identify them.  Powerups: - Right now, there isn't much of synergy possible except for really narrow paths (eg sword or earth). - A lot of powerups don't feel that they make much of a difference. If I do 8 damage with an attack, 5% damage increase isn't that much.  I am looking forward to see thios game develop over the next months.",1
137776584,2337630,"This game leaves a lot to be desired.... It is unfinished, very janky and doesn't play especially well.  Why does this game not have career mode such as Cricket 22, the backend is all there for it to be used in this game.. I should be able to create a player and go through their career to afl level. Dissapointing really.  Game crashes fairly often, Can't play on from outside out of bounds (You can in real life) when on the mark you are basically useless to the person playing on directly around you. Handballing is shocking. Tackling is bad. Players teleport 10 metres and lay tackles.  Can't even make your own team properly and use it in a season, nor can you give them custom jumpers.  Needs a lot of work done on it before it's at an acceptable level. I will only keep it because my kids enjoy playing it.",0
137775946,2337630,Absolutely horrendous... does not run on my 5K widescreen even though the resolution within the settings is set to that.  The gameplan is as bad as I have ever seen on a game.  It should not be this hard to make an AFL game... the game is not even worth $9.99 never mind $99.    I wish I could get my money back...,0
137773675,2337630,"So many bugs. This game really feels unfinished. Just from a couple of hours playing, I've noticed the following:  -The jumper and colours for any custom team cannot be changed. -All ""Free Agency"" and nearly all non-AFL players are the same bald generic player model only with varying heights and weights. Not even sure if their height matches their positions (I made a custom club made up of only the free agency players and my ruck was fairly short). -No Craig McRae at the very least during the 1/4 time and 3/4 time breaks. Not sure if any other coaches are missing. -It's way, way, way too easy to take contested marks. -There seems to be a delay between getting the ball and being able to kick it. I have tried to press and hold the kick button as soon as I get the ball but due to a half second delay I find myself having to charge it up again, leaving me open to getting tackled. -Speaking of getting tackled, you could be running from an opponent and by 2-3m away when you take a kick, but due to the a combination of the slow kick animation, the player also slowing down and the tackler teleporting to bridge the gap, you get caught incorrectly disposing of the ball. When combined with the delay between getting the ball and being able to kick it, this is by far the most infuriating bug in the game. -Quite a number of times, players seem to fly along the ground from way out of position to where the ball drops to take a mark. This could be up to 10m. -A few times, I've taken a mark, then get called to play on after not even a second and without pressing a button due to the player landing off the line. -In the team management menu before games, moving players from the interchange or sub position causes the interchange or sub label to disappear until you back out then go back in. -During kick outs, the back pocket players go to about 5m from you and call for a kick. -Crowd numbers are odd. Just playing at the MCG for round 1 for Collingwood vs Geelong and it seems like 30,000 people are there, which just simply wouldn't happen. -There's been instances where a player attempts to handball, it then ricochets off of another player which launches the ball 60-70 meters. -When you attempt to handball to a player, often the ball will go in the complete opposite direction of where you were aiming (yes, even if you aim the way your player is facing, it sometimes goes backwards). Even if a handball goes to a teammate, it will often just go straight past them. Players also get way too close for a handball to actually be useful. -If a tackle occurs, then a free kick is given, sometimes a player on your team will pick up the ball on their own and despite being surrounded by opposition players, advantage is given. -Sometimes the ball will spill loose in a tackle and nobody picks it up from either team for a number of seconds. -Players are either very slow to turn around or sometimes just don't altogether. They're also really slow to take off. Especially after a handball receive. -Some player models are just off. Not sure why Big Ant claims that every player has been face scanned as likeness accuracy seems to vary. Also noticed some odd things, like Bobby Hill having a big bald patch on the back of his head. -I haven't seen a single high tackle or in the back tackle paid. Do these even exist in this game? -Players seem to almost walk to a marking contest in the forward line. -Sometimes when a free kick is paid for out on the full, the free turns into a boundary throw in before the player even has a chance to kick it. -Deliberate out of bounds doesn't appear to be a thing in this game either as there's been handballs or kicks straight to the boundary with no other player around which just become a throw in. -Names get dropped in the stats list after the match. In a match, my second leading goalkicker (according to the commentary) had 7 goals, but they disappeared from the leading goal kickers list after the match. The leading ball winner (according to the season stats as this was after round 1) got dropped from the leading ball winner list after the match. -In the season stats page, some stats are just bizzare. Just looking at one player, these are some stats: Disposals: 46, Kicks: 34, Handballs: 12, Disposal Efficiency: 3.04% (this is really low amongst 99% of players for some reason but it gets worse), Effective Kicks: 44, Effective Handballs: 96 (although the player had nowhere near that many handballs), Kicking Eff: 1.29 (even though according to effective kicks to kicks ratio, this should be high 90% range), Effective Disposals: 140. There was also another player with 97 effective kicks from 37 kicks... -Interchanges don't occur at all.   Not only the bugs, but this game appears to be void of a lot of features, such as: -The ability to set tactics either during gameplay or during a season or career mode. -The ability to play as VFL/WAFL/SANFL and other teams even though the players are there (even if they've not been added properly). -The ability to view statistics at breaks or in the pause menu (even AFL games from ~20 years ago had this). -The ability to train players or set up training schedules to improve players during the career mode. -It doesn't even have stat updates in the game (like seeing how many goals someone has kicked just after they kick a goal plus a few other stats). AFL Evo 2 had this. -Sprinting only seems to intermittently work.  Honestly, although this game looks better than AFL Evolution 2 and plays better if you disregard some of the above bugs, it feels like a backward steps in some ways. It almost feels like a beta version considering the bugs and lack of features. AFL Live from 2011 (yes, a 12 year old game) absolutely destroys this at this point. And that didn't even have a career mode. It's just a dead-set embarrassment for our game when an absolute mess of a game like this to be released.",0
137776624,2389440,This is a wonderful little puzzle game. The art-style is supercute and I love the polaroid-like/instagram feel of the screen. The The puzzles get a little harder at the end but you have all the time in the world so that's nice. fact that this is free on top is amazing!,1

137774624,1179580,"I hate the chance to look into the game some days before the release and I really liked it in several aspekt, but there are also several cons.  The visuals are pure candy and I really like the low poly look (but I am also a fan of low poly games). The characters are cute and combat is fun. It kind of feels easy until the point you really get hit... this is also the second, where it get's challaging.  I played around 5 hours. The puzzles are fun, not overly complicated and there are quite some jump and run passages. The storyline is simple but not boring while the interactions between the characters kind of have this asian touch in a good way.  Now, there are some negative aspects: This is an early access game and while I think that this is fine for survival games that you play over and over again, I don't really like this in story games you mostly play once. This often means that you never experience the final game. I understand that money is a pressing factor for indie developers, but I still like to mention that.  There are some bugs: texts seem to have been translated from chinese without adepting the time they are shown on the screen. Some text disappear so fast, that it is barely possible to follow the story line.  Sometimes, original texts are popping up.  So all in all: The game is pretty darn good and for less than 25€ it is totally worth a shot, but it might also be worth to wait for it a bit longer. So a total thumbs up but with some limitations.",1
137776469,1837580,"This game is the most unusual thing I've ever played. A very epic start with 2D graphics followed by a change to 3D and a transition to real life. During the game, there are a lot of unusual feelings, as if you are watching a movie and at the same time playing the main character in this movie, influencing his opinion, his choice. It's definitely interesting and exciting. I didn't notice any bugs in the game. Good luck in developing the project, it's really something new-innovative.",1

A lot of that comes from the chaos - in the early levels or easy difficulties some fights are pretty straightforward but the game really shines when things start to go wrong and you need to work together to solve the problem. The rougelike unlocks and the random items and mods make each run different, so there's a lot of replayability.  There are some aspects of the game that get a bit repetitive (like survival and movement missions after you've done them a few times) but overall the gameplay is really solid.

137777509,1294810,"I am really enjoying Redfall's open-world design which allows for plenty of exploration. I appreciate that I can ignore the missions and instead wander the game's map, which is filled with bits of story that add depth to the game's lore.  Visually, the game is stunning, with its beautiful graphics and impressive combat mechanics. The combat is engaging and enjoyable. However, I wish that there were more weapon varieties available for each weapon type, as this would add an extra layer of diversity to the gameplay.  The mobs are a little too easy, especially in multiplayer mode. However, I am still in the first area of the game, and things may become more challenging later.  One issue is that mission progress is not shared in multiplayer mode, which means I have repeat quests if I am not the host. This can be frustrating if you enjoy playing with friends or joining random groups.  Graphically, the game has a lot of settings to tweak, I am usually able to get between 50-80 fps with settings between high and epic using DLSS at quality mode. This is on a RTX 3080 at 3440x1440 resolution.  Overall, Redfall is a visually stunning and engaging game that offers a lot of opportunities for exploration and discovery. The combat is fun, but the mobs could be more challenging or offer higher play difficulties. The lack of shared mission progress in multiplayer mode is an issue for me. However, these shortcomings are outweighed by the game's strengths.",1

I wouldn't mind in the city viewer menu that in the event of getting a resource injection you get a display to show how much more of the extra resource you have in that turn. This might just be me but it feels hard to get souls as a necromancer without going on a warpath and micromanaging every engagement for maximum soul harvesting.

And I've been extremely pleasantly surprised. I've run two games so far - both were feudal societies, one focused on order and Nature, the other focused on nature and astral - I was curious to see if it would feel like the same people given they had the same society and both had nature in their build - it did not.

137778239,1622800,"Super Dungeon Maker is a wonderfully cozy, creative, and nostalgically fun 2D dungeon designing game created by a team of two talented developers with a passion for gameplay and creativity that is inspired by the Legend of Zelda.  While there are a few minor shortcomings, they pale in comparison to the praise I want to give this game and its developers. The devs set out to simply make a good 2D dungeon designer game filled with love and respect for it’s inspirational source, which I think they did in spades. The devs also are very active in the community responding to bugs and feature requests and they've posted a nice Feature Map for new content coming soon. The game itself is delightfully charming and scratches an itch I've had for a long time about wanting to create Zelda-like dungeons. The dungeon designer itself is a fairly impressive and powerful tool that can be used to create some truly imaginative creations. In large part, the amount of  positive feelings I have for this game (as well as my eagerness to overlook its shortcomings) is due to how well I think they implemented the dungeon designer. It's a great foundational framework that I know future updates will only improve upon. All in all, I've fallen in love with Super Dungeon Maker and can't wait to watch the community and the game itself grow. I would say I Highly Recommend Super Dungeon Maker for anyone that's a fan of 2D Zelda games, cozy games, creating dungeons, practicing level design, or simply just supporting two great indie game developers!

137778387,1651490,"My Tiny is currently working a soul sucking job in retail so she can afford to come home and indulge in her hobby of painting in the lovely little park across the street from her house. Of course usually the paintings don't sell for the cost of the supplies to paint them but she's getting there. You know it's fantasy because the job in retail allows for her to have a house, pay her bills, have good food, and allow her friends and sometimes complete strangers access to her house to break her items and make stuff filthy. (You can lock the main house door to avoid this but I find it amusing)  In all seriousness though if you have any interest in life sims and the pixel graphics aren't an immediate no. I'd suggest checking out the demo, taking a look at their roadmap, and reading through the early access game box to get more of an idea of what's there now and what's planned.   Like the other reviewers I'm very interested in the future of this game as the base seems solid and while some things could stand to be tweaked nothing appears outright broken.

This game takes it further than other hockey arcade games with dynamic ability choices that actually give you a higher skill ceiling rather than just allow you to bodycheck everyone you run into.   Arguing against Negative Reviews because half of them are bullshit:  Game too HARD!! : No, it's really not. What you have are people who are used to knowing exactly how to score in their EANHL game on PS5. So they come into this game , which has new mechanics, and they're upset when they can't cross crease 100 times in a game. The game is hard, but it also has mechanics which allow you to PERMANENTLY UPGRADE your character. Ask yourself, do you want a game you can 100% first try that also has mechanics to permanently upgrade? What's the point in progression if you can beat it on first try? People complaining about difficulty are mostly wrong. The game is difficult, but easy mode is easy. Hockey is an exceptionally difficult game to create AI for as well, so mad props to the dev for making quality AI so far.   The game has barebones mechanics: Not true. Does it have a real physics engine and can you use your right stick to deke, etc? This is a PC game. Remember that. You can't make a skill stick on a keyboard. Also, you're fucking delusional if you believe a small team can mimic physics/mechanics of a 30+ year old EA game. Stop critiquing an Early Access game for not having better mechanics than a AAA game that's been patched for 3 decades. The mechanics in this game are great, and for Early Access, I'm blown away. The yo-yo is genius.  There isn't offisides!: People are really asking for offsides. One of these reviews says that you must not enjoy real hockey if you like this game. His team must've just been knocked out of the playoffs because there is no logic in this critique. If you have offsides here, it will be a faceoff simulator. This isn't a sim. Don't critique an arcade game with expectations of a simulator.  Anyone leaving a negative review because there isn't X feature: Look at the roadmap for this game and tell me it isn't everything you could hope for from a small team? Amazing jobs to the devs. To the people leaving mindless negative reviews, thank you for giving me nostalgia to the days of EANHL where 80% of the playerbase would be perfectly quiet about glitch goals but would cry incessantly about people in the crowd having non-realistic animations. Keep up the great work devs, truly.   My only request is if the game is popular enough, mimic EASHL. Online versus would be cool, but if you can create an EASHL-lite , this game would sell like a motherfucker.",1

This is a game in development, it is not a fully released game - by getting 'early access' you are able to see, try, and test it while its in development. This helps companies by providing valuable feedback in terms of telemetry data and player feedback/ bug smashing.   Now to the game itself. Yes there are several bugs - including harvesters which will get their tires stuck on a single rock and it can't escape (which turned a recent PVP match from victory to defeat real quick when 2-3 harvesters had driving problems). That being said though, had a match with some friends and I and we found it highly enjoyable.  The game itself is a mix of Dune meets Starship Troopers with a bit of Starcraft in the mix. Its simple to understand and the UI at this stage looks great. At night the tracers and explosions are epic, and the heatbloom using inferred vision is amazing.   While the tech tree at this stage is simple and can be expanded, I remind that this is early development so things at the moment are kept very simplistic. That being said, the structures are amazing from being built to fully finished. The scale of everything is what I enjoy, as it helps give a feeling of how powerful units are; including how helpless you feel when the larger aliens charge at you.  My main issue/wish that could be changed is to open the player cap from 12 to 24(up to 48) as I think that would help give a more modern shooter feel, but as is its still fun.  Over all I recommend this game, while it is a work in progress and things are kept very simplistic right now - it has the foundation and groundwork established that can easily turn this into an amazing experience.  8.5 \ 10",1

137777559,2337630,"Crashes at the end of every game. I'm very close to refunding, but will wait for the next patch before committing to that. Way too buggy to recommend at this price, but I'm happy to revisit this review if the developer can fix these issues quickly.",0

137778996,2211730,"Great game for the price, but I'd like to see some features for it to be even better. First off a 150 FOV option that is playable and doesn't bug out half the games assets like other games. It is a horde leaderboard FPS and it's quite a good one but I feel it lacks critical information. First off going to the control options you see a prompt for knife dash but in actuality pressing shift+rmb is the same as pressing rmb so idk if that's bugged or what(it isn't mentioned in the tutorial just in the settings). Another thing that also isn't explained is how the parrying works(circle around gun that makes it shoot a one hit beam), I've manage to trigger it 4 times now and I still don't know how, I tried parrying enemy projectiles,didn't work, I tried killing enemies or shooting them when they flash red before attacking, still didn't work so I'd love to hear how it works. Another thing not mentioned is how knife cooldown works, atm it seems like it should recharge faster the less hp you have so you can slash enemies and regenerate faster but in practice it's about 50/50 of being like that. Sometimes I have full hp and it recharges in 1.5 seconds, sometimes it takes 5 seconds. Sometimes I melee multiple enemies at once and it recharges faster, sometimes I melee multiple enemies and it recharges very slow. So I'd like to see these 3 things adressed later in an update maybe that adds an explanation of how they work in the tutorial. Other than I'd like to also see a double jump recharge after melee killing an enemy instead of just one jump bc after 20k points landing between enemies without a double jump is a death sentence and makes you just run away constantly instead of being aggressive(I'd like to hear devs on this since maybe it's intended like that). Enemy design is great and I can finally kill bugs without being grossed out lol",1

137783872,2128270,"[h1]Great bite-sized roguelike with lots of build variety and depth that you'll have a hard time believing is only in Early Access.[/h1]  While it's not as sprawling as Tales of Maj Eyal or has big dungeons to navigate like Cogmind or Approaching Infinity or even Rift Wizard, it sure does pack a nice bite-sized punch! The time of each run and overall pacing remind me a lot of something like Golden Krone Hotel or Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. Not too quick but not too long either. However, I haven't beat the game yet, just died a lot so could be a bit off on the actual length to complete but I am really enjoying the pacing.   Gameplay so far is tight and everything I've tried out so far seems pretty well balanced. Game is really well thought out and has quite a bit of meat on the bone to keep you busy for what I am guessing is a near infinite amount of replay value exploring various race/class/god/skill combos for you to try. There's also tons of awesome loot to find, with various levels of rarity and that offer stat modifiers as well as unique skills and abilities to them which add even more variety to your build similar to something like the ARPG Diablo or roguelikes like Tales of Maj Eyal.   Speaking of builds.. The ease in build creation is staggering and if you enjoy some theory crafting, you'll be in heaven with all the possibilities here. And if theory crafting isn't your jam, don't worry, it's not mandatory to enjoy. Just pick what sounds good to you and have fun. I will say though, you're going to see a lot of reference to Rift Wizard because not only was it a well-known critical success but it was super easy to just plug in and try out anything you wanted with the skills/abilities offered which this game also does. I'd say that speaks volumes because RW is a great game and It's lots of fun and keeps you hungry to try out new builds each time you die which is no different in this game.  Gameplay is pretty straightforward and while it certainly looks like it crawled out of a cartridge or floppy disk from the late 80's or early 90's with it's beautiful, yet mimalistic ASCII artwork, it doesn't have any of annoying bloat that makes games from that era such a drag to enjoy in 2023. There's no difficult commands to remember here, it runs with newer hardware/monitors without issue and the entire game can be played by simply using your mouse. It does have the dedicated numpad keys for moving/waiting turns for those who prefer that method of play but it's by no means required. Dev also mentioned at possibly adding gamepad support and maybe even putting it on consoles which would be killer since there's simply not enough actual roguelikes on those platforms. I use the Nintendo Switch quite often for travel and sadly, there's only a couple decent roguelikes on it like Tangledeep which is good and all but kinda sad at the same time as I'd love to have more like it in my library. Crossing my fingers the game does well and dev can port it all over the place! Would be awesome.   Speaking of success, I'd definitely say the developer did a heck of a job with Path of Achra being as it's their first game and they have no other coding/game creation experience prior and it's still only in EA. Very impressed! I'd definitely consider this game a success in my book and it's pretty wild because it's not even finished. I'm pretty blown away at how well it is right out the gate and am filled with excitement that it's only going to get bigger, better and more complex in time as the sole developer hones their craft. Worth stating that if development was to cease right now, you're still easily getting your monies worth with this game as there's already lots to do, explore and experiment with. As for Early Acess games are concerned, this game feels feature complete, is bug free and is extremely enjoyable.   If you are a fan of roguelikes like ToME, Golden Krone Hotel, Cogmind, Rift Wizard, Angband, Cave of Qud, Approaching Infinity, DCSS, The Doors of Trithius, TGGW, ADoM and all the other awesome roguelikes out there that I love, you'll definitely want to add this game to your collection and support this dev. Plus, this is sadly a dying genre and if you care about it and want to see it thrive, it's pretty much a no brainer to usher out some support. Worth mentioning too dev is kind, hardworking and very active. Can't beat it!   [b]Great game. Strong bones. Very enjoyable and moderately habit forming. Beautiful artwork and music. Lots of replay value. Tons of different races/classes/gods to play and unlock. Mountains of unique loot to find with all sorts of stats and skills/abilities use and collect. Theory crafting & build experimentation is near infinite. Feels feature complete but is only EA. Extremely cheap entry price.[/b]  What more can you ask for? :D  [h1]A++ Highly recommend for fans of roguelikes or just great indie games with lots of replay value, permadeath, unlocks and light rpg elements![/h1]",1
137781725,1277920,"Disappointing  There are some great game play mechanics, but this game is not ready for release. Somehow the developers fooled themselves into thinking the community of gamers would think their lack of polish would be ok.  Here is a small list of problems:  1. Of course tons of bugs due a lack of testing and not enough developers.  2. Has a subscription and you can completed all content in 1 day. The game needs at least 10 maps the same size as the current one totally fleshed out. 3. Classes are not balanced or finished. You also can’t get to the next city where you would progress your class. Many class skills are unfinished, useless or not scaled right. 4. Level scaling is a grind to try and keep you from completing all content in a day.  This kicks in at 6th level. 5. Broken quests, unfinished quests, quests that make no sense. No quest reset.  6. Confusing UI and gameplay. For example there is no clear instructions that you can hit enter and tell the fisherman where you want to travel. 7. Broken and messy UI, Text overlapping, unable to click on elements, etc.  8. Monster scaling is broken. For example the last boss a stone golem is super easy to kill solo while bandits in the old mine will kill you in 3 or 4 blows. 9. The end quest says the game is in Alpha, but the game is being sold as if it is a complete and finished game. 10. There are only a couple recipes to be found. This is super grindy. 11. Many of the skills are useless and then there are actions that should be skills that aren’t, such as climbing. 12. Main storyline starts very interesting but ends poorly, like someone never finished it. 13. Lot of unfinished systems such as the Journal, PVP, most skills. Get rid of PVP and maybe some of the other features to actually be able to finish this game. 14. Lag, lag, lag. 15. Rubber banding where  you run and then spring back to previous location.  This game needs another 2-3 years of development.",0
137784122,1294810,"It's really not that bad. It works great on my PC, and yes, it is a little dull and dated, but it still plays good.

137784051,1294810,"I am not as negative about this game as some of the reviewers.  However, the game really did fall way short of what I expected - especially for an Arkane game with Bethesda Studios.  It feels to me that they just didn't finish the project.  A CoOp game should have a Fortnight-type lobby for people to join with random players. The solo story in some instances is actually not bad.  There were times when I enjoyed the game.  Most of the time though - not.  I cringe that Bethesda actually has this as part of their resume.  I sure hope Starfield doesn't disappoint.  If I spend another $70 on a game like this, I might find myself no longer spending $70 on games like this - you know what I mean?  If you have money to blow, go ahead.  Otherwise, save it for a game worthy of Arkane and Bethesda - this one is not.",0

137783296,1294810,"I think most of the bad reviews, especially from people who didn't even give their try more than an hour, rather less, are exaggerated. Ok, it has it's bugs and flaws, animations look a little weird sometimes and enemies don't have the best ai rn, there I agree. BUT that doesn't mean it's unplayable, sucks or doesn't make fun. I bought other games the past years for their release and it's not as worse as other releases imo. I think it has potential and I actually have fun. Looking forward to continue playing actually.  Most people say there is no story but these people just don't like to read. Like in other Open World/Bethesda games a lot of the storytelling comes from reading books and notes that are around you, looking at your environment, read signs for example, take the world in and suddenly theres a lot of (environmental) storytelling. (bit like in Fallout, read stuff, look around, suddenly you know what's going on.)  The gameplay overall is fun, reminds a bit of loot and shoot a lá Borderlands, which I'm fine with. You have several options on how to approach most places or quests fitting for all the play styles.  The co-op is fun and works good, only thing that bothers me a little is that only the host has story progression. What I really like is, that your characters have little random chats with each other, where they get to know each other a little and you get to know them.",1
137782725,1294810,"Bugs in Redfall game  Redfall is a first-person shooter, open-world, single-player or cooperative game with RPG elements, available on Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and PC. This vampire game, despite its promising features, has some bugs.  The game has some similarities to Dishonored, but some mechanics are frustrating. For example, some enemies can get stuck in the environment or simply stop acting, causing a game-breaking situation.  Furthermore, the AI system is not optimized, and often takes longer than expected for enemies to react, leading to uncomfortable combat scenarios. I found it difficult to navigate through the environment, with objects blocking your path, making it challenging to progress to certain areas and making the game unplayable in some sections.  This is frustrating, making me anxious to continue playing despite these bugs. Redfall is an enjoyable game with a great storyline and fascinating gameplay mechanics. The game has a lot of potential, and we hope that developers will fix the issues in future updates as soon as possible.",1
137782331,1294810,"Redfall is an amazing experience. Not a good one, but an amazing one. You will at every step be confounded to experience the absolute nadir of game design and polish, the sort of thing you'd expect in a ten-dollar Unity asset flip, not a 70-dollar ""AAA"" game. The main challenge in explaining what's wrong is really where to start.  But let's get the obvious out of the way.  Is it really as buggy as you've heard? lmao, yes, YES. And so much more. Erronous world states forcing game restarts, connection issues, keys not responding, not being able to read things after someone else in co-op has read them, the game sending you to wrong fast travel waypoints, geometry issues and floating objects that look bad, geometry issues that create holes you can get stuck in, issues with models and animations, the screen being obscured by various garbage so you have to restart the game, dialogue attributed to wrong characters by the closed captions, NPC's duplicating themselves and carrying on two conversations at once and so on. It never stops.  But I can personally ignore bugs, even quite bad ones, in favour of good gameplay. Does Redfall have that? No. Is it perhaps because I am expecting the wrong thing and Redfall is a different type of game? No. Because Redfall is bad at being EVERY type of game.  Looter-shooter: Incredibly low variety of things to loot and things to shoot, weapons never have interesting or gamechanging modifiers, enemies are levelled with you, not with areas or world states, so gear levels are just treading water to keep parity, nothing else. Trash.  Horror game: Nothing about this game is scary, you are never in any way encouraged by any gameplay elements to do anything other than run forwards and shoot things. Stealth is irrelevant. There is never any kind of reason or motivation to avoid being discovered.  Bog-standard FPS game: Enemies are braindead(don't take cover, often don't notice you) which means that a lot of FPS mechanics(taking cover, approaching carefully, thinking about tactics) don't matter. There isn't even any kind of penalty for getting killed, you don't even need to restart events or anything, so there is absolutely zero tension.  Immersive sim(????): This is not an immersive sim, you just shoot things. Go to hell.  Zero-challenge walking sim with an engaging story: lmao, just, lmao. The story might as well not exist. The characters are dull and superficial.  A co-op game: You know? It has one thing going for it. If you're playing in co-op you have someone you can laugh about the bugs with. But the thing is that the encounters are never challenging enough to make the tactics available to a co-op team worthwhile or cool. Plus, having played it briefly in singleplayer, there are about half as many, maybe a third as many, enemies in co-op and they're much less responsive or dangerous. It is idiotic. I refuse to believe any human being ever playtested this steaming pile of garbage.  And part of what makes it really sad is that in the first like... two hours of the game, my co-op partner and I were super impressed by a lot of environmental detail, like you can zoom in on almost any text in the game and read it, even bulletin boards and stuff. But then at around the halfway point they just started copy-pasting stuff and a bunch of plaques and things had clearly AI-generated not-quite-text on them, etc.  I used to really love Arkane. I got excited for all their games. I kept wishing for a Prey 2. I now really hope I never get a Prey 2, because then I would be insanely disappointed and the future *possibility* of a good Prey 2 would vanish.   Just fold this studio up, it's over, I can't imagine the sort of person who'd buy another game of theirs after trying or hearing about Redfall.  The soundtrack is moderately okay when it's not bugging out and just playing the same awful combat theme on a loop even though there are no fights going on.",0

Other people already wrote pages about pros and cons and how the new mechanics are nice, and they indeed are, unfortunately, the game seems to fail in one key aspect. Making the battles actually fun.  In AoW3, playing the Tigrans, i would play out every battle, no matter how trivial, because their units with various abilities made battles incredibly enjoyable, and most importantly, they had some outright bonkers combos and tricks from the start that made it entertaining.  In AoW4, all races are 100% interchangable, and the early game units are the same, infantry with stabby sticks, infantry with shields and something to swing, bows, scouts that are useless in a fight. Want to do anything else as just overwhelm with numbers? Too bad, those scouts/skirmishers cannot kite the enemy, got no special units that are good at flanking or getting behind them, no berserking dwarves with their cleave attack to teach a lesson about standing close to eachother either, maybe something fun would be unlocked later, if you pick the right books, enjoy doing the same swarming with numbers until then!  Story to drag you in at least until it comes to the good part? Story, what story? Good part? Maybe after a dozen DLC or so, since this is a Paradox game, the price tag is also ridiculously high for what this game is, even if unlike me, you would have fun with it.

Tried two different games and about 10 to 19 turns into each I suffered a game crash bug that repeated each load (or when I'd roll back further hoping to not trigger whatever the crash was).  I'm going to try one more time but I don't like wasting what little time I have to game on a game like this is I have to keep starting over 1 hour into the game.  Soooo dear whoever funded this game and made them push it out early. Fuck you. Let developers develop instead of pushing shit deadlines on them. Idk if that's what happened but 99% of the time when a game is launched in an unpolished state, that is the reason.

137781443,2272420,"Since there is nowhere to give the developer direct feedback, I'll use this space to do so. Bear in mind this will sound critical, but I do recommend the game and look forward to full release! This is just my feedback after playing, in order from most to least important:  - [b]THANK YOU FOR HAVING MOTION BLUR DISABLED BY DEFAULT, H0LY SH!T![/b] Honestly, if triple-A developers could take a leaf out of your book, I'd be a lot happier.  - The copyright! Oh, the copyright. Look, I couldn't care less personally, but you are running a very high risk by straight up using Australia Post parcel lockers. Not only are you using AP lockers, you have the real life AP logo, and even a misspelled website URL on the lockers. That's not gonna fly, dude. I'd rather not see this game run into legal issues over using a real country's national postal service.  I also think you'd be pushing your luck with the ""Pixar"" phone, but at least in that case there isn't any identifiable labelling.  - There is no suspicious parking anymore? This was a really great feature in the first game, where parking on sidewalks, blocking pathways in and out of houses, etc. was viewed as suspicious and would get you in trouble or your car towed. In this game, your car can be right out the front while the police are called, and nobody cares! Literally, I had my car loaded up with stolen items, a whole-ass TV on the passenger seat, right out the front of the house the police came to, and they didn't even look at it twice. Please don't remove suspicious parking! It adds so much to the game, and makes you plan your robberies much more carefully!  - The red police search area on the mini-map is inconsistent, and moves depending on which direction your character is facing. This makes it impossible to reliably tell when you're outside of the search range.  - The in-game tutorials and interact prompt do not update if you rebind keys. This is a pet peeve when it's in the tutorial pop-ups, but it's a definite issue with the prompt. Every door, cupboard, hiding place, etc. saying ""Press E"" when my interact key has been rebound to ""F"" is a problem.  - Related to the previous point, the pickpocket key *always* remains ""E"", even if you've rebound interact. This should be fixed.  - Waiting in a parking lot should not force you to exit your car when finished.  - The music loops are really good! Very reminiscent of the first game's catchy tunes, with more variety. Love it!  - 0.1 weight items are rounded incorrectly. If you're carrying 14.9/15, you cannot pick up something that weighs 0.1 to make an even 15. Something is wrong in the calculation there.  - On that note, if you are carrying 3 of an item which weighs 0.1 (e.g. lockpicks), it should display a weight of 0.3 in your backpack. The current UI layout of ""3x Lockpick - 0.1"" is a bit silly.  - I think tenants getting sick of you ringing their doorbell is a really nice touch, good stuff.  - The ""unstuck car"" feature is welcome, but the terrain is the real problem. Getting your car stranded on a slight incline is terrible, some of the edges probably need some kind of softening.  - Please tutorialise the fact that there's a storage box in your car! This literally doubles your space for stolen goodies in the early game, and I think many people will completely miss it!  - The voice on the phone does not sound convincing in the slightest, it was extremely obvious from the first interaction that it's a synthesiser. If this isn't a priority for you, fair enough, but it truly sounds terrible.  - There should be an indicator for items which are wanted on BlackBay when you go to sell at the Pawn Shop, or stash items in your home locker. Having to double check everything in your backpack before you sell it is a pain.  - You cannot enter the driver seat of your car from the passenger door, unless you open the driver door first.  - Some minor English errors: ""Peak"" -> ""Peek"", ""Parsel"" -> ""Parcel"", ""Mouse scroll button"" -> ""Middle mouse button"", ""The police has been called"" -> ""The police have been called""  - The Level 2 lockpick pin resetting animation only plays while your lockpick is suspended above that specific pin.  - Please allow us to turn off the blue tip indicators on properties.  - The playground equipment has no physicality. [i]I wanna ride see-saw.[/i]  - The bathroom window at 102 can't be smashed  And finally, - I can't sell my electric toothbrushes. wtf.  I hope the dev gets to see this and considers some of my feedback, but regardless of whether or not that happens, I'm excited for the full release! A super promising prologue. Thanks for your time <3",1

137782877,1651490,"[i] Disclaimer: [/i] At the moment of writing, the game is in early access. Many features and mechanics are yet to be implemented, and bugs can happen here and there. If you'd rather have a more concrete and set in stone experience, I suggest you wait until the game's full release. While you're at it, you can try out the free demo that has limited features and content, but can be still played endlessly for as long as you wish!  As an early access product, Tiny Life is already a wonderful experience and a great addition to the life sim genre. It's a casual life simulator, similar to the likes of The Sims franchise. It has a really pleasant, not overbearing pixel art style that hits with nostalgia for older games, absolutely gorgeous. The game's soundtrack is chill, but catchy, the compositions left me humming those notes even while away from the game :)  At first glance the game can feel small, however even with limited content that there currently is, the gameplay loop is addictive and fun, with typical, but still quirky events and interactions. Tiny Life is crafted with a lot of love, and it shows. The game started and currently still is developed by a solo developer Ellpeck, it's honestly crazy how polished and packed Tiny Life is after a few years of development prior to EA release!  The game takes queer community seriously from the get-go, which is amazing! Character creation allows you to set up different features of your Tinies separately from each other, including their reproductive abilities, pronouns, voice type and general looks. Minor personality traits that define little gameplay quirks include asexual and aromantic traits, that actually work :) All in all, the game gives the player freedom to make their characters just the way they want them to be, while recognizing the fluid spectrum of one's identity.  Tiny Life is also one of those games that actually take community involvement to heart, with Steam Workshop implementation from the start. Custom lots and households, hand-crafted maps and even mods, all of which are easy to share and to download*. I can definitely see the game getting overflowed with all sorts of custom content in years to come, which really helps with waiting for official content to be launched. [i] *Sadly, for whatever reason Steam doesn't let me upload my content to the workshop library, but take that as an invitation to check other people's work. Trust me, there's so much good stuff! [/i]  I can't recommend the game enough, it's just so good. It has lots and lots of potential, but even as it is Tiny Life is an absolute beast with hours of enjoyment, it will only grow better and stronger with time ❤️",1
137783908,1566200,If you liked NHL94 this is the game for you. As a hockey player who loves rogue-likes and hockey games this is a 10/10.,1
137783881,1566200,"Very fun game especially for someone playing nhl pc games from the 90s. Im usually a very patient gamer but there is nothing like this out so i grabbed it and loving it.   Game play doesnt get stale bc of all the arcade style power ups that are different every run  It is early access so a few small things to polish up. Sometimes if you have a size or speed modifier and run into the boards with the puck, it will think the puck is out and force a face off. Getting early power ups are a little grindy and should maybe lower the cost of early power ups to get the player more engaged early but those are tiny tweaks one gamer suggests, still a super fun and nostalgic time.   It could use a sandbox mode to make whatever power up combos you want for a game. Maybe a pond hockey 2v2 mini rink mode?  I highly recommend even in its early access form",1
137783643,1566200,Tape to Tape works very well on The Steam Deck.  Game is a lot of fun to play!!,1
137783509,1566200,"Game is fun but most certainly shows that it is an Early Access game and still needs a lot of polish. As the game suggests in the beginning tutorial you really need to play with a controller because the keyboard controls are a miserable experience at least they were for me. I couldn't skip cut scenes for some reason despite mashing all the buttons I could. I had a much better time using my Xbox controller. I played all of my games on standard difficulty so i'm not sure how the other difficulties play.  The AI is all over the place with positioning and my AI Dman like to pull themselves way out when trying to defend the rush so cross creases will be wide open for the opponent. There are talents that makes your players chase the puck or just go around hitting the opposing team but I didn't have those active. Offensively, your AI will sometimes get into a nice spot for a cross crease but sometimes they skate all the way to the corner for an 85 degree angle shot and pretty much take themselves out of the play. Your goalie also plays the puck way out of the net (no trapezoid rule) and you won't always have any passing opportunities once he gets the puck because of where your players are so you have to freeze and take the faceoff. I'd rather my goalie stay in the net when I have a dman coming back to retrieve.  Additionally some of the artifacts do not work well at all in certain situations. I had the rigged faceoff artifact so the referee always threw the puck in my direction. I have had two issues with this. The first being that when you pick the low gravity puck random event there were several times where the faceoff just bounced or got thrown right out of the rink so you waste 4-5 seconds for nothing and pray the referee doesn't do it again on the next draw. This happened mostly in the offensive and defensive zone but did also happen in the neutral zone once or twice. The second issue with that artifact is that it doesn't work completely on the first zone boss. It just negates their ability as well and you take a regular faceoff. I don't mind this but I wish I would have known before I picked it because it says you always win.  The more superstars you unlock the harder it is to get the specific one you are looking for as it seems to always have 2 of the beginning 3 and 1 of the others. I unlocked Cam Amber after unlocking Willie Brie and Chloe Crokett and after rerolling around 10 run starts I have yet to see Cam show up. Would love if the 3 characters were from the entire pool of superstars as it doesn't seem to be the case. Maybe i'm just extremely unlucky.  I would love if they added some sort of catalog that showed all of the different talents and artifacts even if they only showed up after you unlocked them. It would be fun to see what I've used in the past runs. Also if there was some way to track overall statistics of players that would be awesome because some bench warmers play way better than others for me.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to my friends yet but I would love to change that once this game gets fully released.",0

It's missing so many fundamentals that are essential for quality gameplay that I can't imagine this game being considered good.  It's descriptors are incomplete and generic and vague. It's combat is poor, glitchy and boring. It's crafting is needlessly confusing. It's tutorial is absolute garbage and doesn't teach you anything. It's story is vague and boring and generic (like most of the game).   Honestly it doesn't teach you anything, it's main components are boring and the whole thing feels unfinished, like an early access. But it's not advertised as an Early access game but a finished product. It has spelling errors, framerate drops, freezing, it crashed during a loading screen on me. When you die it sends you back to the main menu, no respawn or autosave function.  The A.I. that you fight against are braindead so it makes combat super easy and boring. The game doesn't look all that great, you can't tell the difference between day or night unless you look at the  clock. The rotation controls are inverted, when you open your map and zoom in, it also zooms in on your character so when you get out of your map you're instantly confused. The map has no legend telling you what is what. And I could go on and on and on.  But I'm not gonna waste your time. Just don't buy this game.

[/h1] its bare a lot of the area is empty with just a tidbit of trash mobs sprinkled here and there. its shooter aspect is meh where i find myself shooting at something sometimes and it is dead on but still decides to miss. jacobs ult is bugged where it will aim 3m to the right of anyone you aim at. its graphics are somewhat lacking with a lot of muddy textures and sometimes just straight up see through textures. a lot of t-posing. it is not what have come to expect from Arkane. it is badly optimized with stutters left right and center. (wich has yeeted me off cliffs on multiple occations) its gameplay loop is pretty much do quest get safehouse complete objective if you want to then teleport back to hub and rinse repeat. while exploring the world there are very few quests to be gotten outside of safe houses and hubs and there is not really much that would suggest that you need to search for it. co-op left me on loading screens forever on multiple occations where if i load in singleplayer it does so instantly. i wish they would have postponed it and released it when it was done instead of making it feel like another cashgrab. the most fun i had with this game was within the first hour of this game outside of that it got very sluggish and no big incentive for doing stuff. even with playing it through the first act it still gives no new game elements that actually renew your interrest in the gameplay. its like looking at a crack house from an airplane it might look nice from up there but once you get a closer look its shows more what it is.,0

Combat/loot/shoot is all pretty vanilla but for what ever reason it has just a cool enough vibe to keep me interested - exploring its expansive landscape has been pretty fun (although it can feel a bit empty at times).

137785719,1294810,"Great little game, I have played single player only at the moment, waiting for some of my normal gaming friends to pick it up so we can group up. So far it feels like a run and gun set in a town reminiscent of ""Kingsmouth"" from ""The Secret World"". However the setting has a load of flourishes that you would expect from Arkane, with the instability of the region manifesting in the physical attributes of the setting. This especially comes out in the Vampire nests.    World based story telling via the environment and incidental conversations works well. NPCs are well designed and some (like the priest in the firestation) are rather memorable.     I can see my normal gaming group really enjoying this as it allows them to experience the story telling from the environment. Whilst some of the thematics are especially dark, they are handled with tact and alluded to rather than thrust into the players face.    The main plot seems well written and the missions all work towards the narrative in a round about manner that I very much appreciate. The pace of said story telling feels about right for my tastes. Overall I am having a great time with this game. I can't wait to play along side like minded individuals in multiplayer. I hope other folks are enjoying it as much as I am!",1
137789499,1956560,"For full clarity I do animation for LIFELIKE but I was brought on to do so during Track 2's development.  LIFELIKE is a game that's focused on telling a story and building a world and in my opinion it does so incredibly well, there are small details everywhere that both help the fictional world of Ohio feel lived in as well as enhance the story and the player's understanding of it as a whole.  LIFELIKE uses a turn based battle system with a timed hits mechanic for when you do get into a tussle, the combat is simultaneously really well thought out and simple. The strategies in combat you can pull later on are just fun to see executed. My only issues with the game sadly also are part of the combat system; in LIFELIKE when you use magic you can choose between AM and FM to take advantage of an enemy's weakness- however, unless I missed something there isn't much in the way of a signifier of what an enemy is weak to without trial and error which can sometimes be a let down given how you often have to be strategic with the resources LIFELIKE gives you for a fight. Another issue I found is that some of the minigames don't give you enough of a pause before they begin for you to figure out what to do but similar to my only other issue this is mitigated with experience.  I do recommend LIFELIKE if you've looked at any of the screenshots or video of the game and thought ""huh, this looks neat""/""this game might be for me"" because chances are yeah- you'll enjoy it. The game has an incredibly unique and crisp aesthetic, the story is a wild ride, combat is great once you have everything down pat, and with more tracks on the way I could see myself spending a lot of time in Ohio in the near future. A statement I'm pretty sure has never been said before.",1

Check out our review on I Dream of Indie's YouTube channel HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tge9iW_Z8SE  💖 Fair and challenging turn based gameplay 💖 REPLAY MISSIONS EASILY! 💖 Neon cyberpunk-goodness visuals 💖 Unique twists to a familiar genre in light environment puzzles 💖 Interesting dystopian plot couched in a Battle Royale reality show 💖 Game changing upgrades and equipment options 💖 Environment exploring sections with fan interactions that shape your persona  ☠️ A little too dark at times  This is one of my new favorite games, let alone turn-based tactics games. Showgunners a concise experience that challenges you without frustrating, and I cannot stress how great the mission replay option is. If you want a harder experience, you can play the ironman mode and let your losses really count, but as someone with limited time, I appreciate Showgunners for respecting it. From top to bottom, this is a polished gaming experience you can't miss out on.",1

I have crashed 3 times in the 15hrs I have played, but the autosave system in this game is really good about making sure you don't lose anything really. My only issue with the saves is that it very quickly gets to the ""maximum"" number of saves so I have to do clean up, especially if I have multiple games.",1

137789369,1669000,"Initial thoughts after 2 hours...  Seems like a solid entry to the genre.  It's not too complicated to learn the basics, but I've barely scratched the surface of all the possible combinations to cities building, hero progression, spells, etc...  I'm enjoying the making ""mistakes"" while discovering the world and trying to expand my empire.  Combat is satisfying and it is very helpful to see an approximate power comparison prior to making the decision to enter combat.  I've lightly tried both a warrior leader and a magic leader and though I haven't leveled past lvl 6 with either, both are suitably playable.  There is so much left to discover that I'm sure I'll enjoy many hours playing this game.",1

Before i play, I had some concerns about optimization. But after updating all drivers and stuff, i didn't encounter any problem except Paradox Launcher still couldn't open the game, but I was able to open the game directly from its file, then the game ran fluently at low settings even though I don't even meet the minimum system requirements. Thank you again Triumph Studios alone...",1
137788552,1669000,"This is a huge step for the series and they managed it almost flawlessly.  Quality of life changes all around, including a responsive research system that you can more finely control, while still remaining random enough to keep it interesting.  Species creation and customization is also amazing, and greatly increases the amount of variety in the game.  It feels like everything’s been polished and cleaned up from the last entry into the series, and I’ve been having a ton of fun with it with friends.  There have been a few day-one hiccups, but nothing major or game-breaking.  It will occasionally desync while playing multiplayer.  This is rare, happening maybe once every hour or two, and it self-corrects with the push of a button and a short wait time.  There’s also a couple of UI hiccups, in particular when targeting spells.  Otherwise, the game’s run flawlessly, and is a big step forward for the series.  I can’t wait until they start dropping more content!  It’s definitely been worth it, and I heavily recommend!",1

137786736,1669000,"[h1] TDLR [/h1] This game has a lot of potential and will grow with the addition of a workshop! Furthermore, this game will surprise you with its quality.  [h1] How it feels [/h1] This game lives up to the classic games such as Warcraft, Might and Magic, and Civ. It's fair to say one of the game's most vital points is its flexibility. You never feel stuck to a strategy because the game evolves and adapts through the campaign or custom maps.   [h1] How it plays [/h1] The most significant influence is the magic system which impacts your faction (custom or otherwise), Game modifiers, free states, wandering monsters, diplomacy, unique win conditions, and gear! You can arm yourself as an oppressive warlord or a dutiful scholar of magic who can manipulate the world around you.  [h1] Personal experience with the game [/h1] In the few games, I have played, and as often as I have played RTS, I can say this game feels good. In my first campaign, I made a race of subterranean dwarves that excelled at living underground and building massive industries. During my next play-through, I played a classic banned of marauding orcs that I crafted as a swarming race. I had cast a spell that reduced the size of my entire faction, making them the size of dwarves and converting a few into dwarves.  [h1] progression [/h1] The game encourages growth, such as making allies or enemies through the campaign, making city-states, or wiping out all life to feed your undead scourges. Your exploration and activities will grow your play style by expanding your roster of monsters and fiends to help you. And while the starting faction units are small, your game style will become increasingly more unique as you progress, including the roster.   [h1] Out-of-match progression [/h1] One of the more exciting features of the game is when the game ends. The is not over after a victory or defeat. You get to grow your pantheon of gods from the heroes and leaders that conquered the world, as well as a progression tree that expands your progress further, unlocking cosmetics, new game-altering modifiers, and more!  [h1] Conclusion [/h1] There is A LOT to unpack here, and with the inclusion of the Steam workshop this game has a vast potential to be the true successor to the AoW series",1
137786639,1669000,"Amazing game; improves the previous aspects of the predecessor instalments in every way, while also still allowing for a deep variety of playstyles and customization. I appreciate that the devs kept around certain niche features too, like megacity mode and the ability to play against your own creations. The integration of the pantheon system is great, and the design philosophy behind the adjusted city/outpost expansion is a welcome improvement. I've had no performance issues while running this on a low-end PC, either.  In fact, the overall quality of the game is so high that pretty much anything which I haven't specified beyond this point can be assumed to have been done well. There's already mods which supplement nicely, too (i.e. if you want more colours in character creation).  So, for the sake of criticism, here are the very few negative things, in my eyes (even then, two of these criticisms are more 'mixed' than 'this is strictly negative'):  -Some players might find it odd that verbal unit dialogue consists only of grunts and other non-language, but, on the flipside, there's a solid argument to be made that this allows for a more deliberate degree of ambiguity with regards to not ruining the player's immersion, seeing as you get to customize the identity of your army in deeply thematic ways. If pre-written verbal dialogue were explicated instead here, it would kind of intrude upon the personal idea you might have of what your own army is supposed to be like in terms of personality, ideals, or whatever else.  -The other half-criticism I have is that, while the world generation (called 'realms') has been improved upon in several ways, and now allows for some really unique circumstances and identities, it has also been slightly retracted with regards to the specificity of biome generation; in AOE3, you were able to use a slider to precisely configure how much of a certain type of biome (or biome feature) you wanted to see. That's been done away with, so now certain combinations are inherently impossible (i.e. if I want to make a purely arctic world with 0 chance of any other biome interspersing, I can't do that--although, to be fair, I can come rather close with the options allotted to me). But I can't really write this as being an altogether negative feature for two reasons... firstly, that the new parameters which have been added are a huge upgrade and some of them necessarily restrict certain generative possibilities, and secondly, even in AOE3, you couldn't fully customize the biome appearances in the way that was advertised (because certain biomes had to spawn), but, if I am to remain critical here, I will point out that you could at least get a bit more exact in this respect.   -And lastly, the only truly negative thing I have to say is that it's really annoying how you have to fully start a new game/session in order to customize/create new factions. It would be nice to be able to make a faction without having to commit to actually getting into a game first. You could do this in AOE3. I don't believe the removal of such a feature was necessary.  Overall, 9/10. If I were having performance issues this might be a different story, but unlike some reviewers here, I've had no such troubles.",1
137786428,1669000,"This is a pretty AoW3 clone. Lots of multiplayer technical issues. Out of sync all the time. The game begins to lag extremely after about 20 turns in, forced to reboot it.",0
137786202,1669000,Game is great. Imagine Civlization/DnD/Warhammer all in one.   If you're having performance issues try running it with the beta build. I've heard it works for others. I haven't had any issues while playing. It's crashed just once and the quick save system is generous so I was back on in two minutes.,1

'Early access' here means exactly what it says on the tin, but there's a lot of potential and the modding tools seem very powerful at first glance. Technologically I am very impressed with the design and detail of the backend, and backwards compatibility features (f.ex. converting older saves) is [i]deeply[/i] appreciated (even if it missed a few spots). No game breaking bugs so far, and what errors do happen are behind the scenes with very little affect on the player.  P.S. if the creator of GothLife is out there: pls check GitHub — there's a PR to update it to the latest versions of everything.",1
137787275,1566200,"I think this game is decently fun for about an hour right now, I hope as they keep working through early access it becomes the ""deep and rewarding"" hockey exp they claim.   It's easy to pick up and play and the humor is pretty funny (for the most part), the arcade element has more than a little NHL 94 in it. What I wish is that they took more queues from games like NHL Hitz in adding depth to attacking and defending play. The passing/shooting can be inconsistent at time with players having very odd hitboxes to receive passes, the goalies for the AI will always somehow be massively better than yours no matter how you try and spec.  The customization itself is just very lacking. You get whacky powerups but since the players you start with on your team has such indecently low stats, giving them any abilities is basically a waste since they can't skate or shoot well enough to take advantage of most of them. You only every upgrade the main character, angus, so spending lots of effort ""building a team"" as the trailer suggests just feels awful. Whether you have a good run or not is completely dependent on the luck of who you roll for teammates, it would be nice if after completing a boss you got to keep any other player and build a full team over time that gave you more options. Why don't we have a bench deeper than 5? Let us keep a player every time we beat a boss and then over time we have to make strategic decisions on the lineup card based on the region we are trying to clear and the teams there. Right now it can be fun enough playing short term, but the longer you go the more it starts to feel pointless. This game lacks strategy right now and that is a shame.",0

137786381,1566200,Ever wanted to play hockey but also throw your stick at people or shoot the puck at someone’s head? Ever wished you could cherry pick or crackback check without repercussion? This is the game for you.   You can build a game plan around knocking everyone out and then taking the goalie 5 on 1 and to me that is beautiful.,1
137785825,1566200,"It's good, in need of some improvements no doubt. The opposing goalie is a freak and your team's tender is a total fourth-liner. Can't stop a damn thing even from the blue line. Most of the time you'll get stomped by the second team, some times you'll blaze through to the second boss. Abilities are pretty funny, but don't always work well. Checking is terrible, you lose all momentum. It's like the player stops, throws his out, then has to start skating again. Refs are funny. Worth the ~$20",1

The very beginning felt pretty slow and i was starting to think that maybe this isn't my kind of game, but after getting the sword the game got way better.  The graphics are extremely good so far at least, and the music is really good too.  The rest of this is more of a message to the developer, than a review.  I personally don't like the inclusion of a life system, since we are not in the coin-op era anymore, but that is just personal preference. I think it would be better to make the lives system on by default and give players the ability to toggle it on or off, maybe behind an accessibility menu like in celeste?  Lives definitely won't stop me from playing the game, so you shouldn't stress about it too much.",1
137790082,1494420,for what its worth the game seems to be alright I just can't get over the lack of key binds that are sorely necessary when playing any form of rts not being able to quickly access a building to either build or deploy units makes it very unbearable since I have to select one building at a time in order to produce anything and can't queue up buildings such as the nodes nor are there any control groups not to mention lack of attack move they somewhat do it while you tell them to move but once your armies get big enough their block formation move make it so the outer units never really attack until the whole formation reaches their destination I would like a select attack feature to as it would be much more effective so I can order my units to attack and follow rather than go to their last position crap I forgot my units while expanding and they're dead because they got kited or just sat their like a fool and got shot from distance since I favoured playing the bugs it was quite hard to expand and micro the army at the same time focusing much of my effort expanding nodes took up way too much time and I can't even begin to explain my frustration with the deselect mechanic you click nest you have to manually move the camera scroll across the map to find your spot otherwise you will deselect the nest if you click mini map it happened so many times my wrist is screaming at me from all that excess clicking and back and fourth I just want to be able to hold shift left click what I need to build and have access to a control group of buildings so I can better manage my expansion and production as for the fps portion I have no opinion it did not fancy me never used it once as rts is what caught my attention here,0

137790421,1366850,"Well, I want to like this game as it has some really fun aspects but some other design choices make zero sense.  Why bother winning the first few events? Just get enough points to survive and then win the last event as that's the only thing that matters because for some reason the points disappear in the last round. So if you're winning by 20+ Points but you don't win the finale you get whatever position you're in when the person in 1st finishes? Odd.  Demo Derby isn't fun, not much satisfaction in big hits, when it happens it's like.. Oh my door popped open. The destruction itself just seems pre-determined and loses the same things each time which to me seems like it'll get boring after playing just a few matches of Demo.  The game is the best when it's the mini game's (Bullseye/jetwing/longest distance and so forth) and normal racing events.  So we'll see how this ends up going. But the way winners are determined absolutely needs to be changed and some driving physics need work (My little car loves to front flip almost immediately after going airborne.

137789492,1824960,"Only 2 hours in and I am enjoying the game. The biggest problem I have with this game so far is that killing Zombies is near pointless (See spoiler for more info). It is one of the cheesiest mechanics I've seen in gaming. Also, be ready for some serious jankiness with zombie movement. One second they are down the hall, shambling towards you, the next they have wibble-wobbled their way all the way up to you insanely quickly and you barely got to squeeze off a round or two before they are noming on you. The atmosphere is great. Your batteries last about as long as heavy duty energizer batteries bought by the U.S. military (like 3 minutes, tops) and you will be hurting more for them than ammo. Very suspenseful, even if not very fair and quite cheezy.   *Spoiler alert* - [spoiler] They will just get back to trying to kill you in a minute or two, even if you shoot off every limb they have. So far EVERY zombie has come back to life. Including bosses. Make your shots count and move quickly. You don't have that much time. [/spoiler]",1

137788404,1849360,"NATO's Nightmare is an incredibly addictive and exciting strategy game that takes players back to a time that could have changed the course of history. Inspired by the 1983 NATO military exercise Able Archer, this game was developed by Strategy Game Studio and published by Avalon Digital and makes an excellent addition to their collection of beautifully designed strategy games on Steam.  The attention to detail in NATO's Nightmare is truly remarkable, and the game does an excellent job of recreating a scenario that could have escalated into full-blown nuclear war. The game's backstory, explained through newspaper articles, provides an incredible level of depth, making for an immersive and thought-provoking gaming experience.  At the beginning of the game, players are given the option to choose whether they want to fight for NATO or the Warsaw Pact, and each side has its unique advantages that players can use to be successful in the game. However, the battles in the game are not easy and players must develop a solid strategy to end the war before it escalates into nuclear war. As Einstein once said when asked what weapons would be used in World War III, ""I don't know what weapons we will use in World War III, but I do know that we will fight with sticks and stones in World War IV."" That Game is challenging and players must try their best to succeed.  The in-game sound design is top-notch and incredibly immersive and immersive. However, it would have been nice to have some quieter moments in the game to add a touch of variety and thought provoking to the overall experience.  One of the most impressive things about NATO's Nightmare is that it's virtually flawless, which is a rare achievement in the gaming world. Overall, NATO's Nightmare is an exceptional game that will help players understand the devastating effects of war and the grave consequences of our actions. As someone who values peace, I am grateful that our leaders found a way to avoid such a situation. Kudos to the developers for creating such an immersive and thought-provoking game that will keep players engaged.

Top that off with the BGM, the colourful ambience of the dungeons, and selection of powerups to further your expolration makes it flavourful. I highly recommend this game!!

Now, having seen the final product, I understand where all the effort of the developer went. CoB has become a very smooth and well-thought-out experience. Everything makes sense, everything works, everything looks good, and everything has its place. So my first impression is very positive.  However, I will update my review as always once I have spent more time in the game, understand all the mechanics better, and can comment on the replayability, which is important for games like this.",1

137790032,1294810,"Great concept, looked amazing from the trailers, and good in theory. Had hoped for borderlands style co-op in another amazing Arkane world, but they didn't pull it off well or do justice to the concept and what the game could have been. Having been an avid fan of Dishonored, Prey, and Deathloop, Redfall does not live up to their legacy at all, and falls short in so many ways.  AI is lacking and horrible compared to their other games and enemies don't feel alive, weapons and powers feel lacklustre, controller default feel is spongey and bad until adjusted a lot, graphics aren't up to scratch given how much performance it requires to run, and what could have been a great world and setting to explore feels empty and really lacks that spark their past games had.  Really hoping that it's updated and patched to fix all the issues, make the world feel less empty and enemies feel more alive, please fix it Arkane, it really could be a great game. But at present I wouldn't recommend it, and if you are really keen on it please wait and see how it's patched first.  I'm no newcomer to shakey launches or bug-ridden games that don't live up to their hype, I think my hours spent in FO76 can attest to that. But if I could refund this game, I would.",0
137789456,1294810,"I don't mind putting a negative w/o finishing it. I don't think there's much to see.  This is the most generic game ever. 2 hours in and first thing you notice is (aside from horrible performance) how generic the game is. Generic open world, generic interior designs, some cluster of enemies and unnecessary loot dumped over here and there. The soul of the game, the vampires, are just a bunch of fucking geeks with some of the most simple animations they could ever had. AI is kinda dumbfuck even for a guns-blazing game. I have no clue what they have thought when they were making this just another looter shooter cuz if I must remind you last 3 or 4 looter shoters have absolutely sucked (and yes, even Borderlands 3). Speaking of BL3 or maybe Destiny 2 none of those games have a gracious campaign but they have a shit ton of fun gunplay. Redfall does not have it either. It is also quite obvious mission design won't save the game as they are go to x, do the y type of missions (well you can argue most of the games are like this though) without any substance. But given how trivial Destiny campaign felt compared to its actual universe or how cringe was the BL3 (both also have the most generic mission designs) they had enough core gameplay to have you go for it. I just don't see what'd you lose if you were to quit this game in 2 hours. But out of curiosity, I'll keep going.   Well, it's just 2 hours in but I have that strong feeling I am playing a dogshit. And I swear I tried to be as unbiased as I could ever be. Even soft gaming journalists cannot justify this game's existence. Arkane Austin is not as acclaimed as Lyon however Prey was just a decent beginning, a sequel could have been great. Instead they wasted time and effort on this, asking shamelessly for 70 fucking bucks. I have no clue when the development began how much Microsoft intervened and whether Zenimax were involved in these decision making processes (we had another dogshit Wolfenstein game very recently so... I wonder if these are all a coincidence). It was an obvious dead on arrival and guess what? It's dead on arrival. This is equivalent to the story where Square Enix was unhappy with Deus Ex and Tomb Raider but they still insist on publishing niche jrpgs (therefore making some of the most generic cheapass games ever). Nobody can earth can make me believe this game deserves 70$. It doesn't even look like a 50$ AA game. A Prey 2 project was most likely to create a better revenue despite the first game was heavily overlooked. I just don't understand what these mofos cooking. They think a soulless and baseless co-op/mp game insta sells?   Do yourself a favor and nuke this game out of the earth. Even for 15$ (thank you Nvidia), it's laughable. When one of the most reliable studios on the earth (which published critically acclaimed back to back for years) dare to release something like these... It's simply over. Arkane supposed to be masters of well thought level design (as well as the overall world design). These guys have made an unique puzzle for Dishonored 2 that you couldn't cheat via internet. And now, they copy pasta some safehouses without any shit in it. From Clockwork Mansion to this shitty town... They used to have some creativity which they have seemingly lost at this game due to having limited class abilities and of course they had to be unintuitive too. And, people are at fault because they were expecting a good game? I'll go as far as saying anyone who liked this game has no fucking stomach. I have been gaming for over a decade as well and this is one of the most harsh downgrades you could have ever seen. Now, they have a chip on their shoulder to restore our faith in the industry and whatever left of their studio.     Edit: Given how hard I treated the game I'll give the credits where they are due. Unlike some, I did not find graphics ugly or outdated. It's very Arkane-esque which is always very welcome by me. I like the art design here too and it does not look any worse than Deathloop. The art design of the enemies are kinda cool as well. They are somewhat unique on their own. But these are all there's to it, unfortunately.",0

137793735,2086140,"This game is fun.  However, I can't give it a good review because of a few factors.  The most glaring issue I have being the ""Meta-Progression.""  It's a fantastic ideal and the way things play off each other and synergies is so cool.  That's what I would say if it were possible to unlock it in a realistic amount of time.  After 6 hrs, I've barely unlocked anything.  The key issue here being that I think the currency acquisition is way way way to slow.  That or the prices for things are to high.  The low level upgrades feel lackluster and just eat up more of your oh so rare money.  Secondly, the ideal of getting weapons from killing the planets is cool.  However, the fact that the small ones regenerate is frustrating to say the least.  You barley do any damage at the start and have to struggle to get your second weapon.  Third, I feel like only having room for 4 weapons is a bottleneck that really makes each run frustrating.  I understand that you can get more with the level ups, however the RNG on it is incredibly frustrating.  I've had at least 10 games were I destroy all the planets and just grind until I'm swarmed because I can't get a weapon slot.  Furthermore, it's so outrageously expensive to get the relic that lets you start with an extra weapon.  So just for example.  I've played 6 hrs.  Got roughly 12,000 currency.  Spent 2k on weapon unlocks 1k on helmets and 3k on slots and runes.  I've unlocked 10 spots and have 5 filled.  To unlock another weapon rune, it cost 10k and another 8k in rune lines.  This game has a really cool ideal and the meta system seams really cool.  I just feel like the currency acquisition is really really slow.  Even though my review is bad, I'd recommend getting it for as cheep as it is.  I just hope some balancing to the currency comes around.",0

137794084,1294810,"Despite all the unnecessary hate and toxic reviews I actually found this game to be an ambitious attempt at creating a new IP that didn't tick all the the boxes that Arkane Studios had hoped.  The game has various types of bugs that are common to see in multiplayer games but nothing that has made me get frustrated with the game if anything just makes me laugh as you see an enemy slide across the screen but we know it will get patched soon as this is the norm with games these days but it didn't stop me from carrying on.  I do think the price for this type of game should be lower or should have had a lot more graphical polish made to it so its less fortnite looking and more art styled or realism looking and much better cut-scenes rather than the slide shows.  When it comes to gameplay I found it fun to play alone and with friends, some characters are better than others and could have been better abilities to make them feel more unique than a basic healing class or sniper class.  The game feels very much like a casual game to play with friends and a grind for better guns while playing on harder difficulties as the dusk level is very easy for solo players and even on hard with friends is still pretty easy but its nice to just switch off and have fun with friends.  The story is a bit weak and predictable which makes it feel like the mechanics and style of the game was chosen before the story so you kinda switch off with friends and solo you feel like you want to skip some of the cringe dialogue depending on your character.  I like that the vampire nests and wish they had done more with it or added some other things like this to break up the repetition in the game but sadly it can feel repetitive once your in the second map area.  Its a shame this game is getting so much hate as its still a fun game despite its flaws but could have been much better and maybe if the price was lower then maybe it would of been received better but this game does not deserve all the hate its getting.",1

Unplugged it started to stutter and lag bad- to a point where it rubberbanded and flickered like a mental patient with epilepsy. Plugged inn- Smooth like butter.   Game itself takes a few shortcutts- It makes it feel lazy, or rushed.. perhaps both? Moreso than a artstyle choise. No real cutscenes, still pictures- and dialog up close looks downright horrible- robotic stakato facial animations stright out of Mass Effect one! This is current gen made? wow.. shoddy!! And gun loot- bit strange but it is a lootaton, but it lacks uppgrade option so it makes for a strange reward feeling when u finnaly get gold weapons, just to have it become obsolete a level down the road..   All that aside, the world is empty- because its supposed to be empty, but yes.. it could have done with some propper npc-vampire interactions.. Few survivors running screaming down the road just to get gobbled up, maybe saved if your skilled enough? Screams from houses with actual survivors trying to fend of the biters? People thowing themselves from second story windows to escape the bloodmunchers? Yes, yes and yes.. But I wil be a sunovafish if I claimed that the gameplay issent fun!

And like I said, it runs fine for me.  It's not game of the year material but it's a solid shooter in a fun setting.

137794200,1566200,It's more of a letter to developers than a review.  I like this game and i will probably continue to play it. Cause most of the game it's very good. But it has a couple of very irratating flaws.  1) I don't get why is there no skip button for goal replays. It's beyond annoying. There are some situations that i want to watch or show to my friends in discord but the split is not in the favour of unskipable replays.  2) When i turn off music volume i expect to turn off all music including celebrations. I get that you've spend your resources to compose different music for each team and that is cool and all. But it really gets tiresome after a while. I realize that i've probably wouldn't had this problem if the game had a way to skip replays.  P.s. When selecting a superstar at the start of the campain there is no way to see their passive skills.

137793514,2387950,"[h1] This isn't the next witcher. The book was better. [/h1]  This is very rough game, and I can't really find any positives from the mist of mediocrity and sins towards the genre:  [h1] True colors: [/h1]  You might look at the trailers and see a classic pixel-perfect adventure. An art style focused on limited space and palette, no single pixel representing anything in particular, perfect compromise between abstract and representational art.  However, you quickly see that the game isn't bound by a shared palette, as each piece of art has different colors, blurring the difference between one object and another. Beard of the main character is a blob of grey where each pixel has it's own unique color. This isn't really pixel art, it's just art, pixelated.  [h1] Fake pixel art: [/h1]  But the quality and lack of palette aside, the pixel art is a facade, everything seems to be handled through forces and sub-pixel movements, so you get weird unity-feeling object and player physics in a pixel art game.  The smoothing on the camera is awful and unnecessarily strong. It fails to convey any momentum and constantly lags behind the player. So much wasted effort into a smooth camera when a simple follow with leeway based on screen direction, similar to megaman or mario, would've been enough. There is in fact no leeway, so the camera jerks back and forth when running back and forth, so the smoothing doesn't even do anything.  [h1] Gameplay: [/h1]  The combat can be described with a single word: Ugh.  The movement of every object is janky, as their full motion is pixelated instead of being based in the pixels themselves. These physics puzzles do not fit with the game at all.  There's invisible walls everywhere, which coupled with the incredibly bad art direction make it impossible to have fun exploring the levels. You will constantly be stopped by boxes that use same colors as the background, or run past walls that were apparently in the background.   You cannot know what can be destroyed by a punch until you do, so you will find yourself hitting everything, but this will in turn softlock many rooms so you must run to the start and back to reset it. This isn't fun or interesting.  [h1] Buttons and zippers: [/h1]  There is no tutorial on what buttons to press. I pressed literally every button before I found the magic attack. Menus use words like ""jump-button"" instead of referring to it by the key input.   Jump and attack are mapped opposite of the most common keyboard platformer layout, and you can't change that from anywhere.  Want to leave the game? Test every button on your keyboard, or do as I did and ctrl+f4'd out. Closing a program should always be easy and clear, that's number 1 of making software: It doesn't matter how bad it is because at least you can close it. But this just feels like trying to frustrate the player for 2 hours so they can't refund. Why else would it lack basic functionality like closing the program and changing button mappings?",0
137794278,1494420,"Great game, The mixing of FPS and RTS is very smooth. Even though its early access I've experienced 0 issues. Very much looking forward to seeing this game develop. Well worth the Current asking Price (£17.95 Right now)",1
137793284,1494420,"If you are looking for an RTS or FPS and don't know about the game PLEASE WAIT. The game is early access and does not have half of the features its needs. It is still fun to pick up for $20 and play with friends or others.    RTS side: The Game play is fun like any other RTS build a base units and command. Everything simple to a RTS. This adds more enjoyment when assisting your ground troop friends build up weapons and vehicles to fight the swarm, or as the swarm to destroy the humans as a Goliath. With this though does not cry at the astounding bugs I face as an RTS. This game is very, and I say very beginning of RTS fundamentals. This game needs some serious development of basic features other RTS's have, so do not go in expecting an awesome game. But one with bugs and hopefully features to be added. F.E.X. queuing movement orders, attack move, stop movement, formations, rally points, and a few more not listed. The game has potential and is aiming the right direction and needs these critical values.  FPS side: As you think to begin playing DayZ running across the desert for 20 minutes, and then be terrified to find a giant bug who shoots needles at your face is a terrifying and scary matter. (The running is resolved with a teleporter at your HQ/Barracks) It is fun and terryifing to be a puny soldier shooting down the swarm, and utilize the vehicles available. Though the gameplay is fun, there are missing items which would be awesome to see. F.E.X. Loadouts, gernades, a secondary weapons, and a way to disable motion blur.   There are many bugs in the game, like the harvester being dumb. The AI becomes really easy to beat after the first 2 games. The settings menu is something to be desired. With only one setting to change which is graphics. (I hate motion blur). Pre game setup, no way to add in your own game modifiers. The game is clunky but fun. I hope they continue development and add and patch these items in. I still think its worth it to play and try with friends.",1

It's janky, and hard to play, but this game has so much potential to be an incredible game. I want to be here every step, and see this game become something awesome.

137794033,1824960,"Honestly...  the best VR experience I've had in a long while.  Better than 99% of stuff out there.  I have not had any technical issues at all with Propagation: Paradise Hotel, which is almost unheard of these days when a game is launched.  This game runs butter smooth for me (RTX 3080, etc...).  I would recommend it, for what I've played so far.  I'll come back and edit my review if anything changes, but as of now I'm very, very impressed.  The atmosphere and pacing are stellar.  The gameplay is also amazing.  Honestly, I think this is the best gunplay I've experienced in VR, and for one very specific reason; the recoil.  This game has pretty much everything else that other great VR games have in terms of gunplay (reload, chamber, etc), but I've never experienced realistic recoil...  and it caught me off-guard.  I was shooting the first zombie I encountered in the head and when my aim was thrown off I genuinely panicked.  Every other VR game I've played stays aimed exactly where I started shooting.  The fact that this game has recoil that causes me to readjust with each shot I take... is brilliant!  I love it!  This is the type of thing that every  All gushing aside, I do have some things I would like to say to the developers as critique to hopefully get patched in the game at some point, or at least to keep in mind for the next game.  My experience in the game is limited (only 1h40m so far), but I still came across some details that I think could have been implemented better.  !!SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE ON!!  1. When the US army speaks through the radio at the beginning of the game, it was painfully obvious that it was not a native American speaking.  There was an accent and a pronunciation of certain words that was NOT American sounding, and obviously European.  I don't know if there is a specific reason you have in the game for this man to be American, but so far it was unnecessary and would have been fine with his nationality being omitted completely, imo.  2. There are some lighting effects that are present from seemingly nowhere.  Although the ambiance they add is great, it is weird when you take a moment to examine it (because it looks so good) and then realize that it's not coming from any specific source.  There are a few instances of this (above a door there was red lighting to light up the door sign that came from nowhere, for example).  3. All doors opening both ways is a bit strange, and because it was odd it made me think that it would have been cool if they only opened one way because of added tactical gameplay.  As it is now, I can open all doors in a way that is advantageous to me, therefor there is less suspense and danger.  4.  This is nitpicking, but I only want the best for you guys, so I'm sorry to say this one.  There is a letter, written by a teenager (I forget his name.  But he's the son of your boss, I think)  Regardless, he goes on to explain too much in his letter to be realistic.  He says things like, ""He bit her on the calf and she kicked him in the stomach..."", etc.  These types of details are very unrealistic and also don't leave room for the players' imagination to fill in details for themselves, which always leads to things being more vivid and worse than any detailed explanation can offer.  Many things are better left to the imagination, especially in the case of horror.  If you put less detail in this letter it would have more impact and seem real, because people who suffer from traumatic experiences often don't remember much, if any, detail.  Especially not details like ""he bit her in the calf and she kicked him in the stomach"".  It's better if it said something along the lines of, ""He bit her before she could kick him off and get away."" or, ""He tore at her until she finally broke free.""  5.  That same letter has a blood stain on the bottom right corner, but it's the exact same stain on every page.  I know it's nitpicking, again.  But it was just weird to have this bloodstain on the page, which was obviously meant to add a touch of realism (he had blood on his hand when he wrote it) and then the player immediately realizes it's not immersive at all when they flip to the next page.  Removing the blood on the subsequent pages, or better yet, making them a different pattern on each page would be such a great touch.  I'm sure there will be more things like this in the game, and I'm sure all of them could use this attention to detail.  6.  Emily sort of talks too much.  I have been very immersed in the game and honestly have barely noticed, which is what you want, but in the back of my mind I've known it's too much dialogue.  I can give you the perfect example.  When I killed ""My boss"" and she says, ""I just killed my boss..."", I barely noticed she said anything.  Because I was really in the moment and couldn't bring myself to process her sentiments on the situation.  Once I looked around the room, and saw that things were clear and there was no more danger, I thought to myself, ""Oh.. she just said something that was supposed to be mildly funny...  how inappropriate and immersion breaking"".  I was glad that I barely noticed.  There was also another instance, when a teenager stands up from behind a bed and then ran at me (in the room with the letter), Emily said something that I couldn't even hear, because the teen was already getting up and growling, which obviously got all my attention.  I think she said something along the lines of, ""Oh my God!  The children too!"", or something to that effect.  The point is, it was completely lost and sort of pointless.  Subnautica: Below Zero suffered from this.  The devs wanted to tell a story, and wanted the player character to speak, unlike the silent protagonist of their first game... and it ruined everything.  Many people complained that Below Zero was far worse, and way less atmospheric than the original game, and this is specifically why.  Less is more.  Especially in a VR game, where the experience is MINE.  I should be saying things to myself in real life... not listening to character I'm playing go on and on about things I might not feel or agree with.  It would set your game leagues above many others.  Your game does not suffer from this as much as Subnautica: Below Zero does, but it's still there and less talking from Emily would be better.  You guys have a real gem here.  I loved Propegation (the original) and still play it to this day, and I love this one too.  But it's because it's such a great experience that I want you to know some of the ways that I think it could be even better, for future patches or for future games.  I'm looking forward to everything you guys do from here on out.  There are some really great things happening here.  I'm really impressed with what you've made.",1

137791824,1824960,"Awesome game, but does not work properly with the Index controllers - devs didn't test the game with Index controllers, and the gun angle is completely wrong.  Still this is a high quality release - high-res textures, dynamic shadows, great lighting and high poly count. Using RTX 3090 I got 90 fps with Index res 300% and Ultra graphics setting.  For now, this game may work only properly with Meta hmds. Native Meta drivers are supported for optimal performance.

About the game itself now, as of this moment (just a few days after the shaky launch!) it's just another bullet heaven (unashamedly so, if you can't tell by the title itself), if you like the genre you'll like this one probably.

No sign of life or movement. The bar at the top that shows which direction certain things are, is very difficult to follow. Most buildings I saw didn't seem to have anything going on. I know it's early access but it was boring to try and find what I needed in town.

You actually have to read the quests to figure out where to go and even then most take exploring in the area to find what you're looking for.

137794408,1669000,"Game looks and feels great! Graphics are very nice (RTX3080 @ Ultra settings), UI looks nice and clean. It has nice little details everywhere and the game environment feels very interesting too. Tooltips are great and I like that you can follow the links in the tooltips to find more about whatever is new and interesting to you.    Only played a few hours so lot of things to learn and experiment, but being a Civilization ""veteran"" since the first title. this game a bit reminds of that and at the same time many things feel totally new and fresh.   Very excited about this game and probably going to play this for a long time and sink lot of hours into. Good job devs!  Ps. Unfortunately the game has some crash issues currently though, but I assume/expect those to be fixed soon enough, not worrying too much about that.",1

137796842,1566200,This game needs fighting. Besides that the foundation is very well put together. Highly recommend this if you enjoy slay the spire and hockey.,1
137796796,1566200,"Tape to Tape is arguably one of the best hockey games I've played in years. I seriously haven't had this much fun playing a hockey game in a long time. It's a great feeling when you take a chance on an Early Access game and it doesn't feel like you've been ripped off. My only complaint is that the overworld map is a bit repetitive and could use more variety. The game has a good amount of content, and a decent amount of replayability. If you liked NHL 94, NHL Rock The Rink, and other arcade sports games, you'll feel right at home. The roguelike elements in the campaign are great, and I'm looking forward to whatever comes next.",1

It's well worth the purchase, and I haven't even jumped into campaign.",1
137795824,1566200,"I love the concept of this game and want it to be good, but it's so boring in its current state even for an early access game. There's essentially zero soundtrack and the dialogue is just tedious with no sounds to feel more engaging. The game play itself feels like a missed opportunity with the lack of creativity. I just keep replaying the same game with my players attributes getting higher and ""traits"" that feel unhelpful half the time? Also, if you're going to have a fun rogue like hockey based game, maybe include hockey fights? Remembering old NHL games, the fights even with terrible controls were always hype with your friends. Realistically its a silly hockey game, why not add crazy rinks and customization. This feels more like a vanilla version of the game.  Hopefully they fix this one day. NBA Jam and NFL Blitz managed it like two decades ago, people should expect at least that level of game play from a modern game.",0
137795624,1566200,"Definitely still feels a bit like early access, but fun so far!",1
137794668,1566200,I like this game. If the dev team is serious about smoothing things out and adding more depth this will be a great game. It certainly scratches the itch for anyone wanting hockey. But I'm not really seeing much added past what the demo offered.   The grind for pucks doesn't make much sense. Every battle in the first level rewards 2 pucks. No matter if the game is 1 or 3 rounds. Just beat the first fight with one round and quit. Over and over again. In a rogue-lite there needs to be higher rewards the higher you go in a run. Rewards cost a minimum of 10 pucks. Some cost 30. That's a lot of grind for one added bonus. It seems to work for padding time because there isn't much depth.   Past the grind problems the core game is great. I like it a lot. Once there are a few content updates I will update my review. Looking forward to switching this from No to Yes on recommendation.,0
137797296,1494420,"So, I don't think I have played quite long enough to give a proper full review for this game, so consider this initial feelings.  Nearly all of my play time has been as the commander on the Human side, with a bit of playtime as the alien commander, in games of Human vs Alien singleplayer to learn the game.  So far, my only serious complaint is the pathfinding of the Human Harvester unit. As the sole source of income for your team as the humans, it is a VERY massive issue in my eyes that the unit has a bad habit of getting stuck in the refinery gantry, and its AI would prefer to do a 586 point turn instead of making a wide turning circle which can lead to the unit getting stuck. And, as you may guess, no harvester, means no resources, means no game.  Aside from that rather glaring issue, I only have a few suggestions more than complaints, such as the Humans not being able to build Havester units outside of the ones that spawn with the refinery until tech 4 (final level of research upgrade), which I can already see as becoming a problem once players get more used to the game and start trying to snipe them early on.   I have yet to try proper PvP, but from what I have seen in singleplayer, humans will have an advantage in Human VS Alien games due to their weapons being obscenely powerful, especially in the later game, but with the current issues with the Harvester as stated before, the Aliens will be able to get the large, powerful units far faster than the Humans can, making the game a bit of a ""Survive until the harvester does it's job"" mentality. On the human side, the placement of buildings can be a bit of a problem, as their large, and very space hungry silhouettes take up a lot of the early available space.   Now, in spite of all that, I think this game is so far quite fun. I can see the game becoming a well loved title with time, provided commanders and players work together. The units are interesting, every unit has a job and a flavor to it, the audio design is amazing, and the way they use the ""heat haze"" of the desert to enforce LOS on first person players is a very creative way to keep people from spying enemies miles away",1

137796411,1667180,"What might be a decent single player survival game is greatly hampered by a maddening and frustrating camera angle.  Instead of ever being able to see what's in front of you, your character spins in circles doing the most simple tasks and this means knowing where you are or what direction you are facing at any given time is nearly impossible.  A simple fix by angling the camera  much more behind the character and locking the camera behind the character could fix this.  As it is now, this is a overly frustrating experience that I absolutely cannot recommend.    NOT RECOMMENDED.  Terrible game design by the developer(s) with the camera placement and angle being the worst by far.  2 out of 10.",0

A lot of people say it gets repetitive but a zombie game with lots of zombies is obviously going to get repetitive. This is game feels more of like a survive the horde of zombies with your own funky creations rather than a story driven game and I'm not sure if the creator was going for this but it definitely gets it done pretty well. But if you want a alternative to a more story driven game then SURV1V3 is for you. Not this. Although in my opinion that zombie game is much much more buggy, glitchy, ugly and laggy then this. Good work devs definitely worth a 20 dollars for me.",1

124145771,1730650,"[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2[/h1]  You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/hSadDtxUNFk  I do have mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand, the crafting is pretty awesome in this game. You can make some pretty crazy weapons that are satisfying to use. It's also got some nice core elements to the gameplay. The climbing feels good (but seems to be used only in the tutorial?). It's got online multiplayer coop. However, the combat is not very good and it does bring the whole experience down. I did not try pvp.  You can melee zombies and you can use a katana to dismember their body parts. You can duct tape a hammer and a saw and it's a pretty nice weapon. However, the physics isn't all that great. A lot of the time you can just beat down zombies with the biggest weapon, like a stop sign (you do have to two-hand it). I only saw 3 variety of zombies during my playtime. The zombie AI is not very good. The only difficulty is really the sheer number of zombies and your weapon breaking during an inopportune time. You'll see zombies clip through walls / objects as well.  The basebuilding is pretty barebones. You basically just board up doors & windows. You can also lay down traps, but honestly, focusing on just getting the biggest melee weapons is sufficient to bring down the zombie waves. There isn't really a story in story mode. You do get these comic book style cut scene at the start, but that's really the extent of it. The rest of it is just following the quests which just tells you what you need to do, such as finding items or boarding up an area.  Game is running on the Unity Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting mostly 90 fps on high graphical settings. However, I did notice some frame drops when there were lots of zombies on screen. You do have full locomotion and smooth turning available.   I did have fun overall. It's a nice start to Early Access. However, the game does need a lot of work to make the combat better. It also just needs overall polish.  [b]Rate 6/10.[/b]  [quote]Please note: I received a free Steam key through the Steam Curator Connect program.

Man is this game super disappointing... I was super excited for this game after seeing more then a few youtube videos on it before release and man after playing for over a little over an hour and a half i realized this game honestly should of gotten delayed again for at least another few months as this game is a buggy, laggy, and is dead/nonexistent multi-player lobby's... Its really sad to be honest cause when the game was working it was pretty fun and exciting and had potential its just riddled with bugs and super bad lag even on lower settings.. I and a few other groups literally couldn't finish any of the main story lines either due to the bad lag/bugs or connections just randomly dropping... And now im trying to give it another shot but theirs literally no one online playing or if i do find 1 lobby to join the host usually isn't even active and drops the lobby shortly after.. This game looked good on paper but on execution its really bad... Honestly if you want a good multiplayer vr zombie game try After The Fall as that is a much more fun, stable, and polished game with plenty of content and cross-platform gaming. If the game improves over time i might give it another chance but honestly this game just isn't it right now.. Don't waste your time or money on it",1

First of all im impressed with the love and detailed stuff the developers came in with, like the feature to have a search bar to write in, who you are searching in the map and locate him, a feature that I havent seen in any other game, and I have played almost everything since 90s.  The ''click and do'' system we have here is exactly what we want, thats why we are here, for the something else experience!  The ''inspect and use'' style has such a big roleplay aroma, you got sometimes the feeling that you are in a roleplay ''Hero Quest'' Board game!  The graphic is so nice and cute! Everything in this game is pointing at direction Adventure. Friends, be happy that we finally got a game with such a unique gameplay style. Im not very far in the game, but with what I have seen until now, thank you developers for making such a nice game to sit down and relax. Thank you for the time and love you have been given here, its a blessing to be able to enjoy your Fantasy World.  Im encouraging everyone to try and join! I wish you all fun!  Peace!  -Nyo-",1

If the roast isn't trussed, tie some twine around it just to help it hold its shape.  2. Heat the 2 tsp of olive oil in a dutch oven or a large pot on the stove, over medium high heat.  3. Once oil is shimmering, set the roast in the pot and brown on all sides, 8-10min. Then remove the roast and set it on a plate.  4. Now add the parsley root or parsnips, the parsley leaves, the onion, and the remaining salt to the pot and cook until the onions are nice and tender. About 8-10min. If it looks too dry, add a bit of olive oil.  5. Then pour in the water to deglaze the pot, making sure to scrape down any brown bits from the sides and bottom of the pot.  6. Then add the roast back into the pot, along with any juice that has come off of it. Make sure the liquid is at least half way up the side of the roast, adding a bit more if needed.  7. Let it come to a simmer. Once it does, cover the pot and set it in the oven at 375°/150°C for about 3.5 hours. You'll know the meat is cooked when you can insert a fork or knife into the meat and twist with very little resistance.  8. Take the pot out of the oven, carefully removing the meat and letting it rest on a platter.   To make the sauce:  1. Whisk the eggs.  2. Whisk in the vinegar until smooth.  3. Add in the garlic, and the pepper, and whisk to combine.  4. Take a cup of the liquid the meat was cooked in and very slowly add it to the eggs, whisking vigorously the entire time so that you temper the eggs and they don't curdle.  5. Put the mixture in a saucepan over low heat, to slowly warm while you whisk for a few minutes. Do not let it boil, or it will curdle.",0

137797643,1294810,"In the interest of providing some positive feedback for Arkane Austin and encouraging them to stick it out with this game, I want to go against the grain and state that after about 9 hours of gameplay I'm actually rather enjoying Redfall.  I found the opening intriguing and am curious to learn more about the story, I'm enjoying the open world roaming around New England, and I love the weapon variety and quirky side quests.  It took me about 1 - 2 hours before I started to become immersed in the world and the mood, so for those struggling I recommend trying to play a few hours with friends before giving up and determining the game is not worth your attention.  I have not had major performance issues, though there is some noticeable frame rate stutter and texture pop-in issues.  Still, I have yet to encounter anything that was persistent or game breaking in terms of bugs or rendering performance, so honestly those were not showstoppers for me.  Overall, I think this game has a solid foundation upon which Arkane Austin may build with future patches and expansions, but currently I think it's a hard sell at its present $70 price point, even though I still recommend it.  If Arkane asked me to provide advice on mitigating the launch, which they haven't and most likely won't lol, I would recommend promoting it with a discount in the near-term and working on stabilizing the game (performance, bugs, etc.) as well as providing expansions for the player base.  I would also recommend providing those expansions for free as a $70 entry fee is already substantial and warrants some love to the players who keep the game alive.    Anyway, I'm having a good time and intend to continue my journey through Redfall, even with the negative feedback.  Hoping this review can provide some context for anyone else looking at trying out the game - good luck!",1

137799259,1566200,"I was excited when I saw a hockey game for PC in production and I must say, I was glued to this game for a few hours without realising how much time passed.   I've been playing hockey games since Wayne Gretzky had his nose broken in NHL 93. So with that in mind and seeing the style presentation of this game, I was a little skeptical if this game could fill a hole in my soul of a missing hockey game on PC. Well I can tell you it did just that.  First thing I can say to everyone is that this is not the NHL so just let that go. This is hockey compiled of misfit themed teams that hit the ice and seem to only know the objective; put the puck in the net.  Second thing I can say is that you need to be able to laugh a little bit as this game will bring you moments that bend the ways of traditional hockey. So leave your want of a serious hockey game at the door.   Last, some tips on how to make sure you get the most enjoyment out of this one:  1) Probably best played with a controller and right out of the box, I had no controller issues. I feel like this would be difficult on mouse and keyboard but the option is there.  2) A few bugs but nothing major that I saw. The game ran smooth and no crashing issues. The biggest thing I saw was when you or one of your teammates sticks end up in the crowd, they are constantly skating into the boards trying to fetch it. Eventually they just skate to the bench and grab a new one. So don't let the couple of first day little bugs bother you. It's kind of funny with them.  3) This might not be a big one or include everyone but I have a couple of monitors and the game opened on a different monitor then I wanted. Under options, switch it to windowed, drag it to the monitor you want and switch back to non-windowed. You should be good to go.  To end it, I will be recommending this one to all the hockey fans out there missing a game for the PC. This will fill in the void and give you some laughs at the same time. If you can grab this one while on sale, even better. I will say, don't forget to pass the puck and keep your eye on that referee team.",1
137798958,1566200,"Really fun game overall. AI could use some tweaks and hopefully we'll see season / franchise / online multiplayer modes at some point.

137799456,2056340,"I have never written a review for a game so quickly. Even just calling it a ""game"" would be an understatement, almost offensive. This is a little gem. I've been waiting a long time for it to come out and after less than half an hour of immersion in my thoughts, I can already say that I am thrilled.  In a few steps, nothing, very little was enough. The initial trigger warning was of little use. I said to myself: ""I can do it, it's just a game"" (*slammed fist on table*).   But no, I find myself crying without even realizing it...  I don't think I can ever do anything even remotely close to a speedrun for this mini masterpiece. It's something to be taken with the dropper, slowly, without haste or anything.  I can only speak for myself, of course. For me this very short amount of time that separates playing time from this review, this amount of time has been painful, but in an almost positive, liberating sense. I believe that for too long I have anesthetized my every ""superfluous"", ""negative"", ""sabotaging"" thought, to such a saturation point that ""Room of Depression"" hit me like a boulder, with its semplicity.  Definitely for too long I avoided doing things that gave me even the slightest feeling of pleasure, such as reading, trivially, for fear of being confronted with any critical thought, be it constructive or destructive.   So it was that very short post-it notes scattered here and there in the game, with almost commonplace thoughts at first glance, reminded me of what I try to escape from every bloody day. Ah, no, I won't be able to continue the story tonight, even if I want to (and I want it, porca la miseria).  Just what I needed to wake me up, a sort of constant mental slap.

137800218,1649130,"[h1] MAN! [/h1] Okay I do not often leave reviews ever but, given I was looking for a game, [b] LOVE[/b] dungeon crawlers, and this [b] JUST [/b] came out and I stumbled across it on release, I have to leave a review! I will make this as comprehensive as possible, since if something is worth doing, its worth doing right eh?  What follows is a review based on the game up to the first boss, with initial presentation and basic grasp of game mechanics. I will probably come back to leave a more in depth review after I have completed more of the game.   [u] THINGS I LOVE [/u] (if you are a fan of rogue like dungeon crawlers, read on if you want but I/m telling ya now, just get the game. If you are on the fence, or new to the genre, read on)  -Visuals are awesome. Some crazy cool high def art mixed in a blender with fun simple models, and very diverse dungeon rooms. The sprites are awesome, nothing seems to be overwhelming or out of place. Bravo to whomever choreographed the balance in art styles and combat, it is eye candy, and hasn't gotten in the way of playing the game for me, even when combat is at it's most hectic. -Audio is great as well, whimsical and folky, simple and fits the game like a glove.  -Character Customization! let me say this; I was not expecting it, and definitely not to this extent! I do not want to describe it toooo much but I can tell much love went into this part of the game, when other developers choose the easier path.  Not here! It was a great surprise, as usually these types of games don't bother with character customization.  -Level up/perks- Great choices are offered pretty much every time. And there is an entire system of character growth I haven't even scratched yet at my early stage in the game, but I am very excited and motivated to play more in order to get there!  Okay some things I think [u] could be better [/u] (slightly spoiler-ish)  Enemies- I get that this is physics based, but there is some goofy stuff going on with the enemy targeting system. As far as I can tell, they pretty much only take the shortest route to the player, and do so stubbornly... to the point where you can jump off a ledge, circle back up the stairs behind them as they tumble after you, and rather than take the stairs to get you, enemies just stand there at the foot of the wall letting you whack them into the hereafter... I was surprised to see that my sword could hit them from such a difference in height... I wish the enemies where a little smarter. Taking damage- I also wish they had a little more of a build up into an attack, it looks like most of the enemies just kinda rag doll into you for a decent amount of damage, and they do so at full speed, to the point where if you stand still with a group of 3-4 baddies, at least one will get a hit in... not cool man! There is no preamble to the attack, its just instant... it makes combat feel a little flat at times. Room dialogue? Not sure what to all this bullet point but sometimes I clear a room and see the message ""a clearing up ahead"" or something to that affect, which initially lead me to believe a healing station or something, as is the norm in games like this. But there is never a clearing? Its just another room of enemies... I wish there was like a healing fountain or something, maybe consider changing the wording so I (and other veterans of the genre) don;t go in their expecting something that doesn't exist.  All in all, I give this game at it's day one initial release 8.5/10 sparkles. It has allllll kinds of potential to hit 10, if some of the things I talked about get addressed.   Bravo to the team! I love the game, and I hope anyone that read this found it helpful. (including you developers :)",1

137801865,1294810,"The game is a blast on PC.    Performance:  It struggled to run properly until I updated my graphics drivers and set the game to windowed mode, now it's flawless.  I hear console players are struggling a bit more.  Content:  It's not an action packed non-stop roller-coaster like some of the ads suggested.  It's basically an abandoned town setting with a few groups of humans and the random vampire scattered around.  There are main quests, side quests, repeatable quests, open world enemies, many many chests/bags/trunks to loot, and from what I hear... a whole second map after you finish the first one (I haven't finished the first map yet, cannot confirm).    Quests:  The main quests are fun and not cookie cutter.  There's definitely stories to go along with them, if you choose to read them.  You get side quests from NPCs at your main base and from the ""Safe Zones"" that you unlock.  Setting:  ""Spooky"" doesn't do it justice.  Between the music, the lighting, and the little details strewn about, it can get quite intense.  Replayability:  There are several methods of ""grinding"" (for xp/loot) like the repeatable ""Nests"" and the ""Rook Storm"" just to name a couple.    Difficulty:  There are three difficulty settings at the start (easy, medium, hard) and ""very hard"" locked until you beat the game.  I've been playing on ""hard"" since the start and I find it just challenging enough.  I die occasionally but I feel strong when I wipe a group of vamps or gunners.  I look forward to playing the ""very hard"" mode.  What I'd like to see added:  The ability to upgrade/customize your own base. Improvements to human AI (vamps seem fine). More performance improvements. More encouragement to play multiplayer. The ability to join random games (can currently only play with ""Friends"").  I rate it a 8/10.",1

137801020,1294810,"At present I would only give Redfall a 6/10 and recommend waiting for a sale.  Here is my reasoning:  I have been a fan of Arkane since the release of Dishonored, which I thought for the time was rather unique and innovative. Dishonored II then really fleshed out the specialness of that universe while building upon an already solid foundation. Every time I play either one, I am intrigued by the lore, architecture, and allover aesthetic, so much so that I am hoping for another game (but we shall see.) But then came PREY! My god was that game an underrated work of art. From the beginning I was absolutely drawn in and immersed! I remember forgoing sleep just so that I could progress a bit farther the first day of release. It is a beautiful, startingly distinctive game that I have played for more hours than I care to admit. The neo-deco architecture, alone, was enough to reel anyone in, never mind the actual gameplay, and the requisite and beloved Arkane “play your way.”   Deathloop, initially, I thought was a bit of let down; however, once a year had passed and a major update was released, I revisited the game and played it for two weeks. This game, too, revealed Arkane’s ability to create fascinating worlds and addictive gameplay. I also count this as a triumph for the studio.  Then we come to Redfall, which I already had reservations about considering I knew it was going to be coop (sorry, but imo a lot of us are introverted enough that this is not appealing, but certainly each to their own); yet, I was excited because Arkane had yet to fail me. I will not go so far as to say they have failed, rather I will say that they released an incomplete game that needed a lot more work despite having already been delayed. Somehow this game looks less realistic than Deathloop (which was released in 2021), and the world of Redfall, while being significantly more interesting than the world of Forspoken (wow was that a shitty game), pales in comparison to more recent open world releases like Horizon Forbidden West or Ghost of Tsushima, or even Ghostwire: Tokyo. The cut scenes are just drawings, the stealth kill is an absolute joke devoid of any significance, and the powers—though awesome—are somehow forgettable.   While I do like the atmosphere that Refall is creating, I think it would have benefited from a fall release when we all are in the mood for Halloween and the general creepy atmosphere of that time of the year. The moodiness seems somehow too dichotomous to May, but I guess they had already delayed it enough (I’m being facetious—they obviously had not delayed it enough). On another note, I am irritated by the game’s character creation restrictiveness. Where it claims again to be “play your way,” only allowing certain powers to be accessed by playing certain characters is not “the way I would play.” Furthermore, though the vampires are intriguing, they quickly become boring and predictable, and rarely are frightening or too threatening. As always, the voice acting is superb, but the architecture and design aesthetic is mediocre and rarely innovative, and—at times—also forgettable.  I do appreciate that Arkane Austin was attempting to do something new and that should always be applauded, but I believe despite having ample time to work on the project the game somehow still needs more time to cook. In fact, as it is now, it could have been released into Early Access and I think it would have been more liked. Do as you please, of course, but I recommend waiting for a discount if you are not in the mood to spend $70 on an incomplete game.",1

137801658,1155330,"Time is a bit misleading as I did have the game running while I was working a couple times, I wouldn't be surprised if content was closer to 10 hours. Which is the one complaint that I'll go ahead and lead with, content feels a bit sparse for the price even when the game is on sale.  However, as a big fan of Smash TV back in the day this game feels like an homage and spiritual successor in a lot of ways. The changing between ""dungeon crawl"" and tactical combat was surprisingly ok. The character builds are fun, although the fact that you can very easily 100% them all by endgame takes meaningful choice away from picking the builds as you go along. Almost every character brings a lot to the table (Marcus feels a bit under tuned) although the lack of one basic gun type in end game is felt and a bit odd (when you play, you know, it's tied to one of the few surprises the game story has in store).  The story is bland and fairly predictable, but isn't likely what draws people to the game anyway. This one is all about atmosphere and chewing through hordes of increasing difficulty in style. Reading some other reviews it's worth adding that the content that is here is very compact - unlike XCOM where you have to deal with lengthy sections of meta game, this game brings you from fight to fight at an impressive clip.  Overall I enjoyed this game and would recommend it, albeit at a discount. Were they to release a lot more content in major patches that are included, I would change my tune to a more whole-hearted thumbs up.",1

Well I think Triumph Studios might just have surpassed it with this game or at the very least the potential to.

The UI is not great. It feels very ""Free Asset smash"". The scale of the UI is off, the compass doesn't need to be nearly that big. There is no way to actually see what the Active Effects are, no option to quick sort items, no bulk selling. Very little in the way of Quality of Life, although you do get a Key Item to Fast Travel home right out the gate, which I appreciate.  There is no option to rebind keys.

137804150,1277920,"[i] Disclaimer: This was written on May 2023, and it might not be representative of future iterations of the game. There is a TL;DR at the bottom.[/i]   For a lot of people in the MMO sphere, Ethyrial: Echoes of Yore came as a surprise. The game had very little marketing and online presence, and its release date was was announced seemingly out of nowhere. It advertised itself as an old-school game, taking after games like Runescape, Tibia, Ragnarok Online and Ultima Online.   When I first saw the trailer, the first thing that came to mind was Tibia; a game that I used to play a lot in my childhood. I was surprised to see it also took after Ragnarok Online - another game from my childhood - as it seemingly featured branching paths for the different class archetypes.  The graphics were a bit off putting for me, if I'm being entirely honest. Games like For the King have done similar aesthetics, and it did a serviceable enough job. Although I am hesitant to base my opinion of the game based on art style alone, I would say it's one of the least appealing visible features the game has. The combat effects are pretty mediocre for the most part, and some of them were a bit painful to look at.   For example, the class I was initially playing as, the Enchanter, had an ability called Stream of Life that channeled a healing beam towards a target ally. Accompanying that life stream was a strobe-like light that turned my PC monitor into a miniature nightclub as the particles effects flickered wildly over the span of several seconds. It immediately made me not want to use it, as it gave me a small eye strain every time I used it.  I think my experience with that ability was very indicative of how the game, as a whole, was going to be. What was originally advertised as a charming return to old-school gaming, quickly turned into an bitter moment that deterred me from playing the game.  The character creation was pretty average for the most part, although it did force you to have a beard if you wanted your avatar to be male. A design choice which I personally found to be a bit strange. After selecting a small variety of hair styles, beard trims, scars and clothes, it was time to select your class. I was originally under the impression I would just select the starting archetype, and then eventually progress towards a more specialized path. Unfortunately, you get to choose both your archetype and specialization right from the beginning, making the whole process seem rather shallow. I believe that's on me for prematurely thinking it was going to be similarly to Ragnarok Online.  Once you picked your class and name, it was time to select a server. While the game featured an impressive selection that covered multiple regions, it felt like each one was put together with sticks, gum and prayers. Some of them were for subscribers only, and others advertised themselves as Free to Play.  After confirming my character and server, I pressed the check mark to continue and... nothing happened. I pressed it a few more times, and nothing. No error message, no feedback. It was just the background music, with my newly-made character staring at me.   I eventually joined their Discord server to get some information, and it was a known issue. I simply had to wait there until the servers processed my request. So I waited, for about 10 minutes, before sending me to the character selection screen. Only that it made a character for every time I clicked on the check mark; making about 3 identical clones, with the same name. I opted to delete the duplicates and attempted to log in into the game.  Unfortunately, the game seems to heavily struggle when multiple people attempt to log in, placing you in a really long queue that initially gave you no visual feedback on how long it would take. It gave you a vague non descriptive message, and you were meant to just wait there. Sometimes the request went through after 10-20 minutes. Other times, I'd sit there for an hour before giving up. On the small silver lining, the servers usually let you in right after a server restart, but it didn't take long to have the same problem again.  Once in-game, it played fine for the most part. The game featured WASD movement, as well as click-to-move as an option if you preferred that. There was no diagonal movement, which I hear was a big cause of complaint for some people, but I personally didn't mind.  Interaction in the game world consisted of talking to an NPC, either by pressing Space while standing next to them, or by typing in the chat box a greeting - something I found to be pretty charming and reminiscent of Tibia.   The game had a lot of skills to work towards, and had the potential to progress slowly on different areas at your own pace. Even your spells were grouped under different categories; such as Hydromancy, Spiritualism, etc. I presume the strength of your spells and abilities is tied to how proficient you are with a certain skill line.  When the servers were struggling, it wasn't unusual to have some rubberbanding every now and then, and sometimes the whole world would freeze for a couple of seconds before making everyone zoom in to their intended destinations.  The combat consists on using your cooldown, much like most MMOs out there, while spending your resources efficiently. If you play as a squishier ranged class, there's a big kiting component that some people might find enjoyable, by either slowing down enemies, or making yourself faster with spells and abilities.  From what I could tell at a glance, the game had their roles pretty well defined. Tanks were bulky and resilient; healers were frail but could keep the party going; and DPS dealt a pretty significant amount of damage when compared to the other two roles. I personally enjoyed that, as it made every role feel meaningful. When I came across my first boss monster, I couldn't duo it very well with a Tank/Healer combo, as my Mana would run out before we could kill it and we would be forced to retreat. It wasn't until we grouped up with a DPS where everything became a lot easier.  Unfortunately, you have to subscribe if you want to experience the game beyond the starting zone, which is around 20 hours of content according to the developers. The good thing is that the game has regional pricing, meaning that your subscription should be adjusted to your local economy - making it more affordable for some people.  They also offer founders pack and a limited lifetime deal that gives you a permanent subscription, as well as other goodies. The only other MMO I have seen do a lifetime pack was Lord of the Rings Online, when it first came out. Unfortunately for me, it's really hard to justify a subscription of the game in its current state, let alone a more expensive package.   From what I can tell at a glance, the game has a decent design foundation that lacks the support beams to make it work. While I can dismiss the server issues as an ""MMO launch"" situation, I feel like the team behind Ethyrial lacks the experience to manage a project of this scope.  The game feels like an alpha in many ways, despite being released as a fully fledged product. It certainly doesn't help that their first patch was advertised as ""0.1"", which makes me feel the game is nowhere near ready. I believe that when you release a game outside of Early Access, people have certain expectations on how things should work. Recovering that goodwill on a rough first impression is a really difficult task, but certainly not impossible.  TL;DR: An MMO that takes inspiration from old-school games like Tibia, with a decent foundation that quickly falls apart under the pressure of multiple server issues, bugs and design choices, among other things.",0

Fans of the genre will feel right at home. - Beautifully crafted locations and overall graphics. If you're into dieselpunk, The Running Man kind of theme - you'll love this game. - Pretty straightforward simple story but it's still good enough to make you connect with the characters and feel for them. - Good music that goes with the whole theme of the game  The bad: - Game's kinda short, probably ~20 hours. Don't expect the depth of XCOM 2 or Wasteland 3. - Sponsorship perks are kinda meh. You have 3 options to choose from on each sponsorship level, but in reality only one is truly viable. Everything else feels like a filler or downright useless. I with they'd given this a bit more thought.  The ugly: - Finished this game on hard and i gotta say, either I'm super unlucky or this game's hit percentages are completely screwed up. I'm a huge fan of tactical turn based combat game and let me tell you, I've never seen anything like this. Even XCOM 2 is nowhere near this game in this regard. Miss multiple 75%+ shots in a row - no problem! Getting hit from across the room while standing behind full cover - there you go! And it's not like this happened a few times during my playthrough, this happens all the time in every single battle. Sometimes it feels that cover is non-existent as it doesn't matter if your characters are hiding behind one. They'll get hit anyway, from across the room with a shotgun. I kid you not.

For those of us who are truly onboard with a ""NFL Blitz"" style hockey game, you're getting a fantastic game!    There's obviously plenty of power-ups and skills that are totally off-the-wall, and that's a big part of what makes this game a blast to play -- but, outside of the power-ups and skills, you're actually getting a really well-done game of hockey on the ice, albeit one without line changes, offsides, icing, or two-line passes.  The skating is very fluid, and you have to be far more precise when going for the big bodycheck than you do in EA Sports or 2K's games over the last two decades, which definitely isn't a bad thing.  It is definitely beyond cool to me that they managed to make a ROGUELIKE out of freaking hockey, but for every bit as weird as that premise sounds, IT JUST WORKS.  It's definitely worth your money if you have any love for the sport at all, or even just love for hockey video games at all.  It's also fast-paced enough that someone who isn't a big fan of the sport or the video games should be able to get some real enjoyment out of the game.  This game is honestly one of the best gaming buys I've made in several years.  Bravo to the developers, and I hope this review helps you to pick out a great game to play!",1

137803973,1566200,Dope game. Still lots of balancing and tweaking to do imo.,1
137803823,1566200,"Player-side AI all over is terrible. Your players will not check at all unless you get an upgrade that makes them prioritize checking. Check hitboxes are really narrow/wonky, while enemies have very generous hitboxes.  The really damning part is the game will forcibly change which player you are controlling frequently, and commonly at unintuitive moments. The pass button is also hard-bound to the change player button, so if you want to change players and at the same moment one of your players obtains the puck, you will pass it off immediately.  A minor gripe, but one of the abilities is throwing that player's stick to knock some people down. Because you HAVE to control who has the puck and your teammates never use their abilities on their own, you cannot use this ability while maintaining control of the puck ever.  There's a fun game in here but currently it feels like the game is fighting you in places it shouldn't. I can probably recommend this after significant AI, controls, and player autonomy tweaks/overhauls, but I can't recommend it in its current state. It's just an exercise in frustration currently.",0
137803735,1566200,"I was hoping for a new NHL 95 and this ain't it. The skating is rigid and checking feels awful because of it. Player stats are so important that your backbenchers should just stay on the bench full time. Abilities detract from the hockey game play more than enhance it and make it way more difficult to play with people who are unfamiliar with the genre. Metaprogression is currently way too slow with no fail-forward mechanics for people struggling to win games.  Balancing a game between player stats, different abilities, roguelite progression and campaign choices must have been a nightmare, so props to the devs for attempting it. All the pieces are there for an amazing hockey game, but for the moment I'd say to let this one sit on ice for a bit.",0

137804259,1494420,"Playing silica reminded me a lot of Warshift: https://store.steampowered.com/app/392580/WARSHIFT/  I believe that this product has good potential, unlike a product like Star Citzen that stopped being a game and became a Universe, Silica could use more resources similar to the titan wars between ships as in Battlefield 2142 and or the old Star Wars Battle Front where the fights looked like fights like ww2 only in space, with taking ships and strategic positions.  https://youtu.be/xp5RR8ZE4zU  In terms of RTS, I believe there is a lot to improve in the controls and even in the insertion of fortification elements, in short, there are other games on the market where the study of mechanics can be explored, however I still found everything to be very minimalist, the impression given is that they did something simple to focus more on FPS or perhaps underestimating those who play FPS and who might find an RTS complicated.  I liked the multiple possibilities to play and in this regard if it had even a few elements of an Arma3 present in coop mode it would perhaps be fantastic!  I really like the game Home Wolrd and in this regard your new product Desert to Karkand could be an inspiration for SILICA, where large aircraft carriers move around the scenery with resources inside them, a game with this mixture can be something very different, thus being able to even assault large structures with the infantry and sabotage their movement having true combats within these structures.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxmciajCQEY  Anyway, I believe that SILICA was really created as an experiment, in a minimalist, humble and calculating way in the investment of the product, which makes it a game with a potential narrative, but a withdrawn development and testing only one market, as if one did not believe in the product you are creating!  I will not ask for a refound because I like the theme, however those who have never played something of this nature, I believe there are other more refined games, I sincerely hope that the Bohemia team thinks more and who knows, makes great updates because it is a potential product.",0
137804197,1494420,"Holy f^&*, where to begin.  At this point I cannot recommend buying the game. Long story short, the game is unfinished. Both RTS and FPS parts are missing core features players learned to expect from both genres over the decades. And you don't need +10hrs of playtime notice them.  Before breaking down issues with the RTS and the FPS part, let's talk about general positives and negatives:  The good: + The sense of scale is incredible. Once you go into the FPS part of the game, you see how enormous the harvester is, and how every unit interacts with each other and buildings. It's legitimately superb. + Visually the game looks pretty good. Granted, it's all just light brown desert, but models, textures, particle effects and post-processing are great. + Sound design is really good too. Weapons and vehicles sound authentic and satisfying. + The visual design of units is futuristic yet grounded. + Vehicle handling is really good.  The bad: - For both human factions, majority of buildings are almost identical. It's hard to tell them apart in RTS/Commander mode and it's especially difficult to tell them apart in FPS mode. - There's three tiers of vehicle factories for some reason and you need the highest tier one to build a harvester if you lost it. - Communication, which is kinda like... Crucial in a game like this, is currently limited to text chat. There's no VOIP, no radio commands, no marking/spotting. Nothing. - Map cannot be zoomed in and the icons are very hard to differentiate, because they're so small and often clamped together. - Harvester AI is hopeless. It often gets stuck or just stop doing its job. - Maps are really big, so going from point A to point B is very time consuming, even in a vehicle. - There's collision and fall damage. It's really easy to jump down a building and take damage, or drive into a small rock and take damage. - When it's dark. IT'S DARK. You can barely see where you're going with the infra/night vision enabled. Forget about long-range fights during night time. - Perfomance in multplayer gets worse over time, which seems to be a staple of the Arma engine. - Lack of basic settings like key bingings, FOV sliders, etc. - Lack of modern settings like upscaling (DLSS/FSR).  RTS/Commander mode: - There's no voice overs, no notifications or anything for basic stuff like ""building complete"", ""unit ready"", ""harvested under attack"", ""low funds"". - Queueing up units often requires multiple clicks, for some reason. - No way to preview what's a building doing without clicking on it. - No grid overlay to let you know in advance where you can and cannot place a building. - Buildings cannot be repaired, sold or demolished. - No way to set a rally point for production structures. - No way to queue up orders for units. - No basic commands like ""stop"", ""guard"", ""patrol"", etc. for units - No unit stances (aggressive, defensive, passive, etc.) - Keeping track of where the players are in your team is difficult. Their nametags aren't visible if you zoom out enough. They have no dedicated icons and the icons they have clump up with AI units if you zoom out enough. There's no hotkey to manually select players.  FPS Mode: - Only one weapon per infantry class. You don't even get a pistol as a secondary. - The only 3D marker on HUD is the  order issued by the Commander (if they did give you an order). Nothing else. You might think it's a good idea, that the game's aiming to be a hardcore, immersive shooter but no. You spawn and you don't know where to go, who to shoot at, who's AI and who's a player. - The teleporter map doesn't show any icons, so if you wanna help out a friend, you won't know where exactly they are, unless they send you a screenshot of their map. - You can only change your infantry class in Barracks. Instead of in every building, like in C&C Renegade, a game released over 20 years ago. - You can't manually mark anything for other FPS players around you. - You can't directly buy or request vehicles from the Commander. - You can't accept, deny or request an order. - If you aim at a unit or a building, their alliance and health bar is visible in the bottom right corner. Instead of somewhere where you'd expect it to, like above the thing you're aiming at. Yet another thing C&C Renegade had figured out two decades ago. It's actually impressive devs managed to mess this up. - No hitmarkers. The only way to confirm you hit something is by looking at the aforementioned bottom-right part of the UI. - There's no zoom in vehicles. Most of the time you're shooting at a marker, hoping you'll hit something. - There's no feedback mechanic when you're low on health, both for infantry and vehicles. A full HP tank looks and works exactly the same as a tank with 1% HP. - Human Faction 1 units are identical to Human Faction 2 units. They're not even color coded.",0
137803859,1494420,"I do not recommend this game at all in it's current state.  I've played and backed several early access titles and this is very, very, very early.  It's so bare bones.  Graphics are nice, overall movement is good.  When it comes to bugs they want to climb on anything so you can't do any fine movment on buildings or objects it's too janky.  The UI is not very informative, the maps are huge and it takes like 10 min to run across the map to find the team of 3 players and get killed.  The AI is bad and hardly ever moves, typically just sits there ignoring your commands.  So confusing, you need to learn everything the hard way and who even knows if you're doing it right?  Wishlist it, come back to it.  Not now, not for 20 dollars, no way.",0
137802900,1494420,"I found the game very confusing,  it is almost a take on Command and Conquer, but with an alien feel. Does that make sense.  There seems to be no direction with the game.  Boredom level, marks out of 10 will put this at a firm 10.  Playability, probably a 7  overall would I recommend this game, probably not no, not at this stage.  I just found it pretty  boring and fairly mundane.  I just find it very uninteresting, just doesn't seem exciting.  For me I would say it is lack lustre and not that interesting to be honest.  Would this be my number one go to game, Erm nope not by a  long shot. Thumbs down for me. For the price they are asking for me is just not worth it.  I became bored very quickly with this, so my recommendation would be to avoid, but it is up to you.  I me personally I uninstalled it after nearly two hours of gameplay, so pretty boring to me.  Will I Play it again, probably not no, just no excitement just a meh from me.",0
137804635,2002220,"Hard to recommend in its current state. Has some good things going for it, in the art and music, but everything else is just so mediocre compared to what is out there. The necromancer seems like a decent character, but the other one is so plain. Everything is so slow. You fight against the game to survive, make so little progress, and then you spend your gold on some really uninspired talents. I'm sure it could get better as time goes on and more content is added. On top of that, there seems to be no iframes for getting hit, and some of the monsters that dash at you can very easily carry you along with them and you lose almost all your hp.",0

137803212,1840790,"So far this feels pretty good and worth the long wait/delay. Gameplay is responsive and for an action roguelike, there's quite a bit of build variety. My main issue with this game is the large difficulty spike on the third level, with multiple elites spawning in one room that can lock the player in hitstun, and the spiders that have unfair status effect procs that are often more difficult than the bosses. The first two levels feel fine with no metaprogression grinding but the third one seems to force it.   Metaprogression upgrades are significant and will likely make the game really easy to clear if enough time is put into it, but the combat is good enough that you wish there wasn't such a huge difficulty spike so that an experienced player could beat the game with skill. I consider this to be the biggest draw to this genre for me, and it really does feel like you're not clearing this without at least some grind. Thankfully there are permanent defense boosts in the metaprogression shop, so anyone should be able to clear this in time. If they balance the excessive hitstun and difficulty spike, I think this will be a worthwhile addition to your library. For now though, expect a bit of jank and grinding.",1
137803447,1366850,"I normally wouldn't drop a review this early for a multiplayer game, as the game's balance, variety, skill ceiling and such are yet to be properly eviscerated, but after playing a handful of full matches with a few stage wins and a global win, I wanted to share my experience with this sadly overlooked game.  As you may recall, this game used to be called Stuntfest, and with THQ behind it I am not sure it was officially confirmed, but the assumption always was of a paid game launch that, maybe, would also eventually hit consoles. Fast forward to April/May 2023 and the game reemerges after a handful of betas with a new, arguably worse and more confusing name, promising a free to play early access launch on PC only in mere days. That day has arrived.  Limited marketing and hype and not too much confidence after the playtests meant a very low playerbase for this launch day. According to SteamDB, the game peaked with less than 150 players - an abysmal number for a free-to-play multiplayer title, one without any meaningful single player content barring a cute little tutorial and a free roam arena.  The game only has a solo multiplayer queue at the moment, with squads expected at a later date. Imagine this game as a mixture of FlatOut, Riders Republic, The Crew 2 and Fall Guys. Various tracks and game modes have players alternate driving, jetpacking, skydiving, destruction derbying and more in multiple rounds, with the worst placed players always eliminated and a final showdown declaring the ultimate winner who will have had to master driving, aerial control, and manouver in these highly acrobatic tracks with tons of alternate routes and shortcuts.  The biggest problem is that it's just not very polished. Input lag on the driving is very noticeable, with the cars' grip level that also seems inconsistent, even if the driving model itself isn't bad. A lot of the time, the game's inputs and physics don't work properly, with checkpoints' hitboxes, respawns and out of bound trips causing pain. And even the game's performance is currently lacking, when compared to other much more visually striking multiplayer games on the market.  Sure it's an early access, but the playerbase is already small and there seems to be little reason to keep playing much. The core mechanics are fairly fun when they work, but too often they don't, with the limited variety of the modes and virtually nothing to unlock, gain or to grind for at this stage. There's also plenty of bugs, such as the option menu being borked or how the tutorial was only pushed my way the third time I booted the game.  In the end, launching a game like this, even if early access, makes little sense to me. Non-existent hype and a questionable state of the launch version will almost inevitably cripple this game's long-term chances of success, without which it's hard to expect months/years of exciting updates. Will there be a playerbase to wait out for the game to be in an optimal state? I fear not.  And it's a shame, because if the performance improves, the inputs work better, the input lag decreases, the flight physics become more consistent, bugs are lost, the variety increases, more content and options are added... Jected can become a niche little multiplayer gem, with a high skill ceiling and exciting head-to-head battles of a kind no other racing game on the market offers. But it's currently far from an ideal state, and as fun as the experience can be when everything falls into place, I can't recommend investing the time to ""git gud"" in it. Though, on the other hand, the fear of the game's poor lifetime makes it worth a try now while you can do so.",0
137803062,1366850,"ill put it this way i put 6 hours into redfall and this is far worse than that.   i was really excited to see this, but jesus christ this has the worst driving model i have ever seen in a game.   i cannot recommend this game especially as a competitive game, the lack of precision across all aspects of the game make this thee most frustrating experiences i've had all year. i like the ideas here i do, i liked riders republic, i like flatout i like the premise but whatever they did to make bugbear leave is the worst decision they could have made. wreckfest is top tier and for destruction and weight, but this?, i cant even really describe how most things fuck you up. some environment you can drive right through some you cant, there is no clear indicator when to leave your car, if its taken too much damage, its just i don't even want to spend anymore time typing. i hope to god they fix it but as it sits i wouldn't give it the hard rive space.",0

137804898,1824960,"This might be the scariest VR game. It's very Resident Evil-like, but the zombies are much more aggressive and faster. Also, this game is much darker and requires the use of a flashlight often. You'll find ammo, antiseptic, & batteries along the way. Your resources will get scarce, and you'll start to panic. You will die a good number of times. My 1st playthrough took close to 4 hours, but my 2nd playthrough in the video below took 2.5 hours.

137803284,1824960,"So just like everyone has already said, the game is pretty much a Resident Evil 1 in VR. Shoot zombies/flee from them, gotta do the ocasional puzzle, explore EVERY SINGLE ROOM either for the ammo (which you´ll probably need, *especially* if you chose the harder difficulties), batteries for your flashlight (the whole game is incredibly dark) or the secrets.  I´m reviewing this quite late, so I´ll just write a few pros and cons and call it a day:  Pros:  - The atmosphere is awesome - Gameplay wise, with the exception of a couple of problems on the physics, feels great  Cons: - There are a few cheap jumpscares. I´m all in for a horror game with great atmosphere, but man did I get pissed at some of those - It´s really short. Even tho I died a few times, I managed to complete the game in just 3´4 hours. In other games I would have felt scammed about this, but the overall experience and the price/quality ratio was more than worth (for me) - Dunno how to hide spoilers, so instead of ruinning the ending for you guys, I´ll just say it ends reeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally anticlimactically  Pro/Con (?): - Even tho like I said before, the whole game is pretty much R.E. on VR, it definitely focuses A LOT on the horror. Which is more than fine by me, but some people might try it expecting cheesy lines while zombie shooting, just to cr*p their pants later on",1

Absolutely sold, I preordered the bite back version.  I'm not going to go over every little detail as professional reviewers can and have done it better. The game is an under baked mess.

137806900,1294810,"Redfall is a solid game that delivers what you should expect from a game like Generation Zero. The world is well-designed and does not feel empty, with a wide variety of vampires and other mobs roaming around. While the game could be optimized, this is typical for many games upon release and should not detract from your overall enjoyment.  However, it's important to note that Redfall is not a game designed for solo play. It's best enjoyed with friends, as this will make the experience more engaging and enjoyable. Playing with others will also give you a chance to take the game at a more relaxed pace and fully explore the world without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.  Overall, if you're looking for a game that offers solid gameplay, a well-designed world, and fun co-op experiences, Redfall is definitely worth checking out. While it may not be perfect, it delivers what you should expect from a game of its type, and its flaws are minor in the grand scheme of things.

The game had potential some nice enviromental story telling and a solid ambiance if the ennemies were actually made a threat at night.  Skip this one wait for a price cut and even then only consider it when the game is fixed. Also forget coop throught the mess and crashed its non existent.",0
137806338,1294810,"Okay, I've played a few hours of this, both solo, and with a friend. I know there's a lot of comparison of it being between Left4Dead/Back4Blood and Borderlands in description, but the there's more of a State of Decay 2 aspect than L4D/B4B to a lot of the navigation due to the open world aspect.  Cons: It's buggy. The AI isn't great. Navigating the interface to get graphics to the proper resolution and display settings is resistant AF (I did get it there, eventually, after several tweaks and restarts). There are occasionally framerate issues.   Pros: The AI isn't non-existent. It's visually pretty. It's functional. co-op/multiplayer works well. I haven't had any crashes.   Overall, it feels not quite fully baked, and it probably would've done well with some open beta to help tune things beforehand. However, as frustrating as that may be for what's supposed to be a full release, let's be honest: That''s pretty common these days. That said, it's NOT a bad game,, and doesn't deserve the level of negative scoring/rating it's gotten from reviews on here. And I'm saying this as someone who bought the Bite Back deluxe edition.  It's playable.  If you don't want to navigate the quirks, then wait until they've been able to address some of them. I don't mind navigating that, and helping them with the process of fine tuning the game.",1
137806115,1294810,"Let me tell you something.  This game is not another Fallout 76 or Cyberpunk 2077. Those games were LITERALLY unplayable on launch.  I don't get all the hate. I can at least PLAY this game. There is the occasional stutter and texture streaming issue with the textures loading in but other than that i have been having fun so far. I've been playing solo and will try multiplayer soon.  A lot of people are really not giving this game a fair shake. The world is fun to explore, the story and dialogue is all there, you can explore buildings and break windows and climb around the city, there are vampire lairs to clear.  I haven't even gotten to the Vampire God Lairs or the god powers associated with them, and i've only tried Devinder out of the 4 characters.  I'm not sure what game other people are playing but i'm enjoying Redfall. Is it worth the full price? Probably not, but the hate this game is getting is INSANE.",1
137805975,1294810,"This is a beta. This game is not done, there is just no way. The AI is..not intelligent. Mobs and NPCs are buggy. The world is empty and doesn't feel lived-in. There isn't anything to spend scavenging points on. The stuff at the vendor is always trash. None of Remis skills really excite me. Ditto with the talent tree. Its all kinda meh. I can't speak for the other characters.  To be clear, I don't blame the devs. I blame the idiot in the suit(s) that pushed this deadline. And if this is how they treat their customers, god I feel bad for their devs. I guess the marketing team did a good job, because I sure got hustled. I actually thought this game was going to play like vermintide, or deeprock galactic. Because that's what the trailers implied. So even multiplayer is a wash. This will be the last Bethesda/Arcane game I ever buy.   To top it off, I played an hour and a half longer than steam permits for a refund, so now I'm stuck.  That said, the game has potential. The bones are there. The devs needed more time and I bet it would have been a good experience. Fuckin suits fucking up gaming. On that note, end capitalism.",0
137807306,1155330,"I saw a review of Showgunners online a week or two ago and I was super intrigued, and super excited for the release. I'm a big fan of turn-based tactical games and the sortof futurey-cyberpunky genre and so this looked like the perfect game for me. I bought it on launch day, and after playing for a bit, I just couldn't get into it. The combat felt somewhat too easy (playing on normal because even though I play a lot of turn-based tactical games, I'm not exactly *good* at them), and the out-of-combat exploration just didn't feel that fun, and on top of that, I really couldn't get into the story. I don't know. I'd say it's definitely worth trying, as the game does look fantastic and even though it felt too easy to me, the combat felt really good.  tl;dr: good game, just not for me.",1

137806473,1669000,"Waited until I am just about to win my first game before posting. This game is bomb. Think 4X like Master of Magic/Might and Magic/Fallen Enchantress mixed with the tactical combat of something like Into the Breach.  Comparing it to AoW 3 and AoW Planetfall: I was a little disappointed that the campaign is more generic than AoW Planetfall, and it doesn't have near the same level of story telling that AoW 3 had. The world is mysterious and left vague, but the event system from titles like Crusader King's focuses storytelling into the campaign missions in a way that feels fresh and makes each playthrough unique.  The unit upgrade and modification system at face value seems less customizable than in AoW Planetfall. This is deceptive, the units upgrade by type, and the buffs are tied to the Magic Tomes which act as nodes in a research tree. This is an elegant flavored system that provides a lot of unique playstyles and focuses you into bundled abilities that synergize well rather than in Planetfall where you just tried to jigsaw something broken.  The empire management is vastly improved from Planetfall, but the core of it resembles the same. The Empire Development track is a welcome addition, adding a lot of unique abilities that synergize cross-track, but also helps optimize vertical and horizontal playstyles.  The ability to play tall seems to be better than in AoW 3. I won't lie, but I need to play around more with tall civ in this game as well as in Planetfall.  The tactical combat feels the pretty much the same as AoW 3, but with the QoL features that would've made it pop. It's shares the same interface as in Planetfall, but the damage type and conditions system has been toned down for a focus on buffs and area control that resembles more like AoW 3.",1
137806056,1669000,"Eh, it's not the huge hype I've seen many people claim it is, there are some extremely frustrating aspects to the game like how unbelievably unbalanced it is, some units are just plain op and they aren't even a high tier (looking at you dark knights). The wonders are fun, but some are basically/literally impossible like Golden Gate spawning 2 additional Lost WIzards with it's first summon, dealing with 2 is already near impossible, but 4? my 2400+ army lost to golden gate when the auto-battle feature said 'safe victory'. That's how broken Lost Wizards are and they need a serious nerf.  Overall it's 'fun' I haven't ran into a single good aligned NPC yet though, they're all evil and build grievances with you so fast that declaring war never has penalties. One time one of my 100% vassalized free cities just randomly turned on me, didn't know that was possible. It was after I sent them a bunch of troops to so that's fun I guess.",1

137807209,1566200,"I attempted three runs of the game. Each of them ended when the opposing team just became gods and would score immediately after face-off racking up scores like 7 - 2 in their favour. My goalie always feels useless with the opposing team at one point scoring from the half-way line during the second elite game. The hitboxes on checking opposing players are so precise that I can barely ever get one off but constantly find myself surrounded by three players bumping off of them and losing control of the puck constantly. Once I have lost control of the puck it is entirely up to me to get it back as my AI teammates not only bump into me constantly while I have possession they also do not body check ever. They will just kind of hope that the puck lands in their lap. There's a complete lack of hockey games on Steam and this one is genuinely fun when you are ahead but getting there is an absolute nightmare and it becomes immensely frustrating when you are not and none of the AI can be bothered to help. With improvements to the AI, Goalie and body checking hitboxes this game could be genuinely fun. However, currently it just feels really unfair. Especially when at the start of every game you have to take three bench warmers as your teammates and they all have horrendous stats to the point that if you switch to one to defend you will find the opposing player has skated around you before you can rotate to stop them.",0
137806985,1566200,"Before reading, please take in consideration that I have played just about every hockey game, from the Atari to modern hardware. I will use references to certain hockey games of the past which will allow diehard hockey game connoisseurs a reference point. This review also takes place after my first completion of the campaign.    If you want the short answer: Buy the damn game! It’s fun, very challenging, and has a great dev team. The game plays awesome on the computer and on the Game Gear…I mean the Steam Deck…   Really Long Answer:   Tape to Tape takes a new spin on the game of hockey. Many will claim it’s like “NFL blitz meets hockey”, but we already had those games from the 90’s, 2000’s, and present such as NHL Hitz, N64 Gretzky Hockey, Super Blood Hockey, and Old Time Hockey.  Rules or the lack of rules is one of the selling points of this game, as many newcomers to the sport won’t understand how icing works. In this arcade style game, you can murder freely, even turning non-puck carrying players into chalk outlines. The ref is there for two things mainly, one is to drop the puck and the other is to screw you over… Yes, the ref will actively screw you over by counting goals that had no right being called a goal…it’s a “feature”...  The campaign plays as other hockey games “season” mode would, but with a major twist. The twist being, it plays very much like roguelike games, such as Enter the Gungeon. Each challenge grants a Talent/Artifacts in the form of a reward, and those rewards are based on RNG. So if you have pissed off the hockey gods… You’re SOL… Yes, winning has a direct dependence on what Talent/Artifact you get. If you want to stand a chance at winning, choose the Talents, Artifacts, and stat boosts wisely.   Please keep in mind that the AI teams, well they get these talents and artifacts too…and some you have never seen before…with some making you just stare at the screen in disbelief… Oh and the AI is strong in the cheese factor. The AI can pick corners from center ice. It can score by shooting the puck at the back of the net and it will magically go through the net and count. AI teams will light you up so much, you will need sunblock from the lamp being on all the time. Again, most of these are “features”...   Hockey veterans will tell you that there are very very low percentage zones in the attacking zone where you can’t score from. Well that only counts in real hockey and sim hockey games, where in Tape to Tape, you can score from every damn spot on the ice. Even saw one goal scored after time ran out. Time ran out and then the AI takes a shot from center ice to win the game.  Hockey vets also know about “The Cheese spot” in every hockey game. From NHL 95 to Super Blood hockey, there is a spot on the ice or a move you can perform, where you can score just about every time. This game has that spot/move, and it does take away a little bit from the game. It forces players to play in a certain style, and will limit some players' play style if you depend on that one spot/move.  Overall, the game is gorgeous, plays smooth, and handles like a top notch hockey game. Just keep in mind this is an arcade style game and not a classic hockey style game. It does have “classic mode”, but you really bought the game for the it’s new take on the sport. It’s a fun game, if fun to you is being beaten by a breasty leather clad mistress who flogs you with Bauer sticks. Is this the best hockey game on Steam? Very well could be.  Lastly, this is to the devs. You literally put the steering wheel on the wrong side of the Zamboni. It gives me Forest Whitaker eye every time I see it…",1
137806596,1566200,THIS IS SUCH A FUN GAME. I've been waiting for a decent hockey game on PC for so long. My only request is you add an alternate control scheme that allows usage of the triggers and sticks like the NHL games. After a few thousand hours in the EA NHL series using their skill-stick system it is very hard to go back to shooting with X or passing with A.,1
137806589,1566200,"In the age of EA's cross-crease cheese, short-side glitches, skill stick exploits, and the same Be-A-Pro intro for the 4th year straight, Tape to Tape is a breath of fresh air for hockey video games. If Slay the Spire & 3-on-3 NHL had a baby, this beauty is what's popping out.   3 hours in on standard mode and I've been humbled by a team of cheating refs, an all-girl team that use their rear end as their special abilities (you'll see), and a demon-cult team which are like the referees again but with demon powers (good luck). Every new arena was a new surprise; and usually a one-way ticket back to square one to rethink strategy and get some upgrades. I've seen some comments about difficulty and unbalanced AI, but I think the ""unfairness"" of factors like awful RNG or your AI goalie day dreaming during a slap shot all add to the satisfaction of progressing further than the last time.   I think the developers have a lot of potential to bring the various ""superstars"" to life with more believable dialogue/interactions with the main character - it's a goofy game and I think they should fully lean into the goofiness. The campaign is somewhat of a story, and it will feel a lot more like a story if more attention is given to the player character and his teammates/rivals. More attention to customization with the player's team & teammates would amplify the fun of grinding this game. Can't wait to see what additions are made!",1
137806171,1566200,"Very unique and fun take on a hockey rougelite.   Improvements I'd love to see: Let us pick our superstars from the start.  Allow players to change the colors of the puck outline and player debuffs. Having all red makes it hard to distinguish.  Colorblind modes, especially since there's red vs green teams.  Allow players to choose which direction they're attacking, instead of alternating between attacking up & down after periods.  Allow players to choose what color jersey they wear in the campaign.  Allow players to skip goal animations. Still show replays when refs overrule a goal/no goal.  Better music. The music that plays after games is very annoying.",1

137806055,1566200,"Great game.  Don't get discouraged by the initial difficulty, it took me 7 attempts to get my first goal then it only took 2 tries to get past the first area and now I can consistently crush it.  Once you get the hang of it its just a really good time and with the power ups you can get real creative with how you score goals (yo-yo powerup can get some exhilirating ones).  Some advice:  When you're just starting out, Kelly Jelly is insanely unfair, speed is the best stat in the game Play real hockey on defense, clog passing lanes There are no penalties so hit other players off puck especially when they are by your crease   Use your power ups often  Note To The Devs: Make rubber refundable  Rubber incentives based on how well you played (extra for mercy rule for example)",1

Harvesters are slightly smarter than a snail tripping on LSD. You are going to need to build ten of the buggers to notice any sort of income. But harvesters are not the only slow thing. Everything is a snail's pace. Unit production takes forever. Buildings take even longer. There is nothing to do while you wait. You can scout the map, even harass, but the AI also takes a serious dive here as well. If you are not playing with friends. Expect to spend a solid 30 mins just watching progress bars. No rally points for factories, or any reason to be strategic is very noticeable.  If you want to know how to win every time? As humans: Send out the dune buggies to harass any bugs. Just stay at range. Find the shrips, kill them. it's GG. If your a bug: Just kill the harvesters. They can't build new ones (until really late game.

137805914,1837580,"I am a streamer who is doing what I've titled ""The Year of the FMV"" where I explore FMV games both old and new not only as a celebration of an interesting style of gaming, but also because I'm interested in creating my own. So far I've learned a lot, and this title is no different. Seeing how Wales Interactive has evolved as a company has been a real treat. They added in Streamer Options so that the game will pause for streams, which is phenomenal. Their writing has improved as well as their sound design.  Some critique that I have is very small and most people won't even notice it. It's little things like some lines that could've used another pass, tweaks to voice lines so they don't sound like they were performed in a booth, vfx adjustments... just little things and nothing that would be significant or against the story.  Overall, the performances stick out, everyone feels like a unique character, and though the pace of the story is short (which allows for working with branching paths that actually matter in an easier way), the locations make some sense. It has a Goonies vibe, which I'm completely for. Also, events that happen in the story (which I won't spoil) are shocking in the moment.  Buy this game. Support these people and their hard work. It's really cool to see a story where choices matter and it means that. It's not as ""interactive"" as other games, but the way in which they handle the style of FMV is really satisfying. They definitely have a feel, so it's generally easy to tell when a title is by them. All good signs, in my opinion.",1

Alas that is not what happened.  Graphics are a 6 out of 10 at best.  In 2023 I expected much better than what I saw in the game.  Even on epic settings graphics seemed mediocre at best.  Not a great start.  AI is pretty much non-existent.  Every and I mean EVERY enemy I encountered would stand there while I ran right up to them and shot them in the face.  It was as if they were just waiting for me to kill them.  They rarely reacted and when they did it was as if they were in no hurry to respond or react to me.  While the game ran fine there were a fair amount of glitches here and there I encountered.  Enemies got stuck on geometry, animations were a bit quirky, and event triggers seemed a bit delayed.    I really hope that Arkane goes in and fixes this up.  This whole ordeal feels much like Back 4 Blood when it launched.  I hope they don't treat it like Back 4 Blood and jump ship the way the devs for Back 4 Blood did.  Currently there is no way this is worth $70, not even half that.  Do better Arkane!",0

137809007,1669000,Actually good.,1
137808861,1669000,"So Everyone has their like and dislike so this is just my opinion of this game. If you like it good for you if you don't well you aren't the first.  Okay So i am a AOW fan played the 1st to 3rd game skipping only planetfall. I am also a 4x fan so yeah games like CIv and Warhammer done that. Also i know that the game is more of a sandbox then a actually AOW campaign game.  So for ppl coming into this game thinking its a AOW game... Well sorry its basically a Sandbox game. Why i say this...... AOW is about the story as mention this is my opinion. The game has some story ""World"" but compare to the previous campaigns it is lacking...  For ppl thinking this is a 4x Game.... Welllll yes it is. Think Humankind . there isn't much trade resource, Resource is link to mainly gold, mana, food, research and production. it doesn't effect what units can be built. There are wonder and things that once you get 3 of it grants you some boost. Diplomacy is lacking since you don't hav much to do apart from making friends and making enemy. you can trade but the lack of ""trade resource"" make it boring. pretty much i just send them the 50 buck and that it they will either wanna be your friends or hate you. City states grow fond of you abit too quick imo but they are naggy at times so i guess its okay....  Units. you have culture based units which includes, Scouts, Archer, battlemage, Soldier and support. you can then add more units from certain tome which give you more archers, calvary and battlemage and afew others, then you get Summons and also units from the wonders which you can get from duty of liege and random event. overall tome units have more skill then base units  Ranks. Units starts at Recruit each rank up you get more health, at ... i think it was elite or champion you get 1 extra skill or get a promotion to another unit and then legendary which give you another skill. the skill are the same depending on what units it is archer all get eagle eye at legendary. i have seen 2 promotion units, Feudal Pikeman and Copper Golem.  Rank up is done poorly imo Spellforce conquest of EO makes it better.  Tech....... well its called tomes here and they are link to the 6 ""Element Affinity""? you get 9 tome for each affinity 2 set from rank 1 to 4 and 1 for rank 5. There are condition to get rank 5 like need 5 shadow affinity or something. each tome has about 4-6 Items to research. you might be able to get other tome or research items from random event. in 1 game got a ""demon"" that came asking if you wanna get a cryo tome. what item available to research are random from what you have gotten but there are so little you can research you can pretty much get what you wants easily. I blame my Civ gaming for this but there are just toooo little to research.  Spell. you get battle spell and global spell. most global spell will have persist spell that rank perm bonus  as long as you can upkeep it. other are just a 1  time use like summon or change landscape and so on. Battle spell..... seems like your stuck to 3? From my game play Buff and debuff are more useful then atk spell. Strengthen spell.... my 2 full stack legend lost to 3 full stack of recruits-veteran with pretty much the same tier but they have fire range atk and strength buff 22Plus damage per hit.   city building. Your Pop are unhappy with any and all improvement on the land build farm they aren't happy, mine same, woodcutter same, quarry yup unhappy. building are pretty much for resource increase and units nothing much to talk about  Custom World.... This is very nice you can make a custom type of land and weather, and the most fun is a world with ever changing landscape as loong as its not claim and ever growning mob but i have no idea far placement for players are about 7 to 8 turns away.  Custom Race. well you know the races, you seen the skill and cultures. nothing much to talk about. just what tome you choose will change what they call you.  transformation. Seriously 1 of the things that got me was the transformation but meh it wasn't that big of a deal imo after playing. you do get some bonus like flying or invis in forest or walk faster just to mention afew ah also some cosmetics change.  Overall it feels like a okay but lacking 4X game might be more fun in multiplayer i guess. So to buy now or later.... Wait for a discount or even better wait for DLC then wait for discount.   As mention this are my opinion of the game if your happy with the game good for you if your not well you aren't the only one disappointed.",0

I haven't even started customizing any Godir yet - so I'm sure I'll be putting a few hundred hours into this game most likely.  The multiplayer is actually really well done imo - for a 4x. There is re-joinability and game session states - it does sometimes get ""out of sync"" but the game session feels like I can always ""get it back"" by reloading /exiting, etc. I have yet to lose any games states, which for me really makes this game more enjoyable.",1

This experience taught me again to just try the game anyway (if I really were interested in the game initially) whenever I see negative reviews on the first day launch complaining about game performance. I think we're just in a period of transitioning, game pc specs is getting more demanding but gamedev posted a not really demanding PC requirements. I wish they would just put the recommended requirements as high as they think it would be to be on the safe side, rather than have people complain about game performances when they thought their pc rig is enough just from reading the recommended requirements.

137808408,1622800,"This game has a solid foundation that supports cross-platform level sharing. However, it currently suffers from some bugs and an overall lack of tools. It is not 100% clear what all you can do with some of the tools available. This does not feel like a 1.0 launch, and I worry it may suffer the same fate as Rogue Heroes if not properly cared for. This game's release should have been delayed to further polish what they have.  I am pleased with its built-in bug report system, however, which allows you to send screenshots and videos. Hopefully this will help the developer(s) elevate the game to where it needs to be.  I do still recommend this game if you are a fan of games like Super Mario Maker. However, at the time of this review, the game is young and needs polish.",1
137807970,1651490,"As the game literally just released into Early Acces, I don't want to get too into the features (or lack thereof) currently. I trust that the developers are working on things like seasons, pets, different life stages, etc. in the background.  I do want to focus on what's here. The foundation for this game is very solid and enjoyable. It's not yet at the point where I could sink hundreds of hours into it, but between Early Access and the demo I've easily already sunk 15 - 20 hours into this game. For the price, that's more than worth it to me. I also really enjoy the queer and trans inclusive stuff that's already in the game as well. I hope there can be even more stuff going forward, especially stuff like neurodivergent tinies (ADHD, ASD, etc.)  This game is very much like the old school sims games, where needs deplete pretty rapidly and you spend a lot of time managing them. IMO they deplete a little too rapidly, especially energy and entertainment. E.g. if your tiny goes jogging once they'll probably need to zonk out for a nap immediately afterward, even if they just woke up. And I feel like on days where my tinies work I'm sending them to bed at 4 pm because they're so exhausted. It might be a little jarring for players of newer life sim games. It can especially get very unmanageable when you've got a full household of tinies.  The developer is also VERY responsive and quick to act on feedback, which is something I love to see in Early Access titles. I made a feedback suggestion on something small and it was implemented into the game within 24 hours. if you have comments or suggestions then I *highly* recommend using the dev's feedback form. I think as long as they continue listening to players, then the game will turn out great.  I plan on revisiting the game in the future as more features are added, but for the price I'd say go ahead and try it out if you think it might interest you.",1

137809180,1566200,"Tape to tape is a great hockey game that provides players with an immersive and exciting experience. The game is designed to simulate the fast-paced, physical nature of ice hockey, and it does an excellent job of capturing the feel of the sport. The game features intuitive controls, stunning graphics, and realistic gameplay mechanics that make it an enjoyable game to play.  However, one major drawback of Tape to tape is its lack of multiplayer. While the game offers a single-player campaign that can be challenging and engaging, it does not provide players with the ability to play against other people online or in local multiplayer mode. This means that once players have completed the single-player campaign, there is little else for them to do in the game.  Multiplayer functionality is a crucial aspect of modern video games, and it is a feature that is sorely missed in Tape to tape. The ability to compete against other players online or with friends in local multiplayer mode adds an extra layer of depth and replayability to games, and it is something that many players have come to expect from their games. In the absence of multiplayer, Tape to tape may struggle to retain players for an extended period, which is a shame given its otherwise excellent gameplay and presentation.",1

137808627,1566200,"this game sounds very nice on paper. my concern was ""is the hockey gameplay any fun?""  sadly its not. if you want to controll a different player you either press a button or use the right stick. almost never you will get the desired player and if you do, the momentum of the player is often so bad that you cant chage direction fast enough and the ai player is gone.  checking doesnt connect the way you would think so you often check the air.  your keeper is basically not on the field. the ai scores from center line and you cant get past their keeper even with upgraded shots from close range. i lost a game 5:0 cause the ai scored with 5 shots from center line with nothing i could do.  one time i used my stick to knock down an opponent. he got passed to and stood up instantly to score a goal. usually they are down for a few seconds. because of stuff like that you often feel robbed and punished even though you havent mad a mistake.  this game does not feel rewarding nor fun to play. often you just feel like you have no controll over the situation and are just rolling dice.",0
137808239,1566200,"Been a ton of fun so far. Couple issues I'm seeing- players occasionally getting stuck in the wall, my goalkeeper getting pushed out of the crease and then going behind the goal while trying to find his way back, and the ai once passing straight into their own goal.   Also, it'd be really nice if there was a way to skip goal replays (unless I just have no clue how to do it), and for the keyboard users it would be great if it was possible to reassign keys.",1
137807972,1566200,"This game looks good, and that's about all I can say for it.  Playing the ""campaign"" you unlock 2 pucks per win. And you need 10+ pucks minimum to buy the most basic things. It quickly escalates.   If you manage to run to first boss each time (unlikely) that's 6-8 pucks a run.  Which would seem fine but the game controls like trash.",0
137807699,1566200,"Finally, a refreshing, and somewhat simplistic arcade hockey game that brings us OG's back to the days of NHL Arcade 3 on 3.   As far as being in Early Access, the game does have some issues and glitches; However, overall it is a pretty smooth, fun and wholly unique hockey concept that i'm glad to have experienced, despite hearing soccer-like chants in the crowd (what sport are we playing! ayyyyy ohh ayyy oh ayyyy ohh - anyway)  Without spoiling story, deeper mechanics and the rouge-lite elements (<3) - lets quickly get into team selection - building your team of 5 players for some good ol' 5-on-5. Naturally, there are top and bottom skilled players. Without skipping yourself, a semi decent player, you'll select a ""top player"" with at least one beefed up stat (speed, power, etc.) and then you will receive three random bench warmers with poor stats (ha! very realistic) and you're off to the shinnys.   The game play starts off fairly straight forward - I played on default difficulty and with a controller (game recommended) which requires minimal button inputs and a single analog stick to control the player. In the current early access build your AI players leave a lot to be desired defensively, sometimes defending, sometimes skating off to nowhere. From time to time if you let them be, they might poke check the puck away. Offensively, there seems to be some disconnection with your AI team mates on how to properly get into position for clear passes and dusty one timers, making it difficult to score most of the time (I admit, im no NHL 99 pro). Deking with one analog stick is tough, but not impossible as far as beating the goalie. I've scored more than a few goals, but sadly I've taken a lot of L's too (which ends your journey, bringing you back to the start with anything you've earned (rubber pucks, power ups etc).  Transitioning onto the defensive and trying to switch to back-skating players, or changing players while defending in your zone almost always causes your player to skate further out of position, or in general makes situations worse vs the offensive team. Trying to perform checks on players is pretty well not worth it (Good lord, would you just hit the guy, please!!!)  Honestly though, i had a blast playing the game (which also worked well on the steam deck) despite its downfalls. If these various mechanics and issues get improved in the future, which it sounds like the devs are committed to doing, I look forward to seeing what comes next.",1

137807467,2337630,"For the moment I wouldn't reccomend putting $100 towards this game, unless you are an AFL fanatic.   For me, the biggest problem with this game are obviously the ridiculous amount of bugs. Stupid things like the AI being way too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, and other things like handballs going 50 metres and AI not tackling/spoling. Another huge loss which AFL Evo 2 did way better (never thought I'd say that), is the fact that there are absoloutley no stats you can see during the game, no disposal count, no free kick count, you can literally just see the scoreboard. Stats should be the first thing they worked on! Should've been the absoloute bare minimum. Don't get me wrong, the cut scenes are cool but after seeing the same scene 10 times in a row, I'd much rather just see the games stats. It's just really dissapointing seeing a company release a game that was so unfinished.  Now for the positives, the graphics are actually really good, for an AFL game, aside from the few faces that aren't scanned properly. The cutscenes, as mentioned before, look really good, and the stadiums for the most part look great as well. The gameplay definitley has potential for now, it feels a lot smoother than previous games when not glitching or bugging, and the goal kicking for set shots is elite. The chipping around the ground and ability to switch also feels really good.  I'd suggest waiting for the nexct major patch if you are looking to buy this, the potential is there, but was definitley released undercooked unfortunatley.",0

137809101,1239300,"Gravewood High is a phenomenal game that completely blew me away with its fantastic gameplay, intriguing storyline, and immersive atmosphere. This game is truly a masterpiece that sets a new standard for the survival horror genre.  One of the things that I loved about Gravewood High is its unique blend of survival horror and puzzle-solving gameplay. The game is full of tense moments and jump scares that will keep you on the edge of your seat, but it also requires you to use your wits and problem-solving skills to progress through the game. This balance between action and strategy creates a truly engaging and challenging experience that will keep you coming back for more.  Another thing that sets Gravewood High apart from other games in the genre is its stunning graphics and immersive atmosphere. The game takes place in a creepy abandoned high school, and the attention to detail in the environment is absolutely stunning. The dimly lit hallways, eerie music, and creepy sound effects all work together to create an atmosphere that is both terrifying and captivating.  Finally, the storyline of Gravewood High is one of the best that I have ever experienced in a video game. The game follows the story of a group of high school students who must survive the night in a haunted high school, and the twists and turns of the plot will keep you guessing until the very end. The game's characters are also incredibly well-developed and relatable, making the story even more compelling.  Overall, Gravewood High is an outstanding game that is definitely worth playing. If you are a fan of survival horror games or just love a good, immersive storyline, then this game is an absolute must-play. I cannot recommend it highly enough!....

Some negative reviews come from who people who royally suck at the game and expect to beat it within the first hour. It's a roguelite, morons, you're meant to fail for a bit first. Like Hades, for example.  Can we take a second to appreciate the massive crybaby who, after 0.7 hours played, critiqued the game about how many pucks you get and how long it would take. After you practice a bit, getting past the first boss is not hard and that rewards 10 pucks alone. It's completely fine.

I played the Alpha and yeah it was fun and good but dear god this is horrible I mean I've had and played bad launches with new MMO's it happens but how do you have pop in with a game that looks like this?  How is the questing system and UI so fundamentally f#cked in a game where most of the time should have been spent on the questing system and UI? I mean are there hidden Hi Def cut scenes were missing? Did the budget go to a secret char creator we don't have access to yet? Ive seen games like this launch before with issues but this is hands down the worst I've ever seen literally unplayable. Im level 6 and cant move on because im stuck in a forever loop of completing my class quest going to turn in and the quest giver asking me do you have said item? I say yes and he then tells me to come back with the item... that I have.. Just a massive mess and its fundamental its the devs not the idea ITS YOU I would strongly and I mean strongly suggest you hire people that are capable of engineering this game to be playable and getting rid of who ever was responsible for this launch.

137812839,1294810,"Without matchmaking the game is quiet, I played Devinder who has the best abilities for exploration, and taking down vamps. The main story lasts under 6 hours, it requires you to complete 8 side quests which are kill quests mostly to even progress, with all side-quests I was able to find I beat the game in under 10 hours, some other time was spent doing the meaningless ""vampire nests"" all of which had the ""blood trance"" modifier making them quick and boring. Most of my other time was just on the pause menu(forgot to close the game) which prevented me from returning the game in the first place.  story is ok, it's your general vampire storyline with a bit of that void magic thrown in, I expected more cannon from the shared universe but the only things I noticed were the whale byproducts from dishonored.  boss battles were boring, just that, weren't hard at all, all of them save the last one were just somewhat varied kill quests with extra steps.   I encountered only 4 bugs in the game which are listed as follows:  1. occasional T-posing npc (only encountered three times)  2. unable to crouch or use abilities (happened three times, usually after a mission complete, could be fixed with a return to title)  3. clipping issue with a few objects (various places where you could get stuck, solved via teleportation with Devinder ability)  4. not so much a bug, but lazy implementation, because the game is meant to be played as a group, several times throughout the game you hear things about the other playable characters, and in two cases you are referred to as a group even while playing solo.

137812691,1669000,"This game is so poor quality...  --------Garbage attack animations that either clunky (stone giant) or just hitting air (bird units or serpents), some units even dont have it like goretusk t3 unit that just comes face to face, stops, then enemy just takes damage.  Magic animations and effects are all the same for most of the units (both missile or aoe) - its just a circle, either in front of a unit or on the ground. What is more, devs cant even make option to play actions 2x more speed permanently, when animations are pretty fast and still enjoyable to watch or maybe scroll button to chose your speed in percentages  (while people asking them to do it sinse AoW3). So you always have to click 2x button speed in every g0ddamn battle (not telling about x3 speed).  --------Models are ok, some good but some with things that dont intend to be near them ( like bastion t3 unit) . And i just started playing and have not seen all models yet. But my experience from AoE Planetfall tells me there are gonna be lot more poor made models of units. Granted, many models were taken from their previous games or just copy paste, like bird units. Embarked units are just another level of disgrace. You guys did them better even in AoW 3 that is 10 years old. There they are just poor made ship models, same for all units , without even imaging embarked unit in it. --------Battle interface in this game is something. Its enormous, gives almost none information. While every unit have a giant green circle indicator of health above them, covering half or more than a half of them, turning every battle in a giant green circles mess, while i want ( or i suppose every normal player) to watch and to admire the view of my troops. Moreover they are really uncomfortable to see whether your units survives or enemy dies or just how long will buffs or debuffs linger. --------City expansion is shabby too, devs just took it from AoE planetfall and made it even more tedious and not so deep, piling strategic map with useless countless sectors and buildings. They also took crappy acid lighting from previous game - say goodbye to your eyes. In addition, game cant even generate rivers properly ( they can be flowing in one direction for 3 hexes in a row , then opposite in other 4 in a row and then change direction again). Just for you to know - there were no such problems in AoW 3. --------Plus, races lost their identity. No special race units or different race features that were in previous games. Race here is more like a skin. Plus, idiotic temporary heal mechanics while all your heals are temporary exept ones per strategic map turns. --------No campaign. Really, who needs it when you get sh1tty hats for longer ingame time, while game itself costing like AoW3 and AoW Planetfall in summary (for my region).  --------And these are just problems that lie on a surface,  sufficient enough to spoil your time and waste your money in vain.",0

These guys were quite capable at prioritizing emergencies and you can even have them ignore specific systems so you don't fight with them over a gun, for example.

137814136,1512050,"Counting the free demo I checked out, I've sunk about three hours into this game so far. Not a lot, but enough to have mastered the basics. Given that this is early access and developed by a single person, I'm quite impressed. I haven't run into the bugs that others mention, though no doubt I will at some point, that's just the nature of gaming.   I find the art style to be charming and fun, which is a big plus; zooming out to see my turtle in space and some other turtles around it gives the game a very unique sense of scale. I do agree with others that the tutorial is a bit clunky and truncated, but it was enough for me to understand the basics. The UI really isn't as bad as some have made it sound, and several easily toggled settings on the screen allow you to make it less busy to your taste, or give you more information if you'd prefer.    I do appreciate that the dev appears to be very responsive on Steam and elsewhere, which I'm sure is probably quite an undertaking for just one guy doing QA, coding, etc. as well as probably having a day job.  As far as individual issues I'm running into, my meeps don't seem to know how to gather clay even when I point them straight at it. I also seem to have spawned on a section of turtle that's a bit of an island, with no way to get off it, including building a waterway which my shores are too steep of terrain to construct, and I can't venture farther to see much beyond my shores in some directions. I'm sure I'll run into more things as I play more, but I'm having quite a bit of fun so far.

The environment does capture a creepy since of stillness that a town should have after being taken over by vampires.  While not a large open world to explore, it captures the feel of a small island town.  The art design is perfectly fine and very Arkane in style.  The big issues I have encountered were a couple of bugs where I had to restart the game to fix them and the AI is a little spotty.  Sometimes the enemies see me and every one of them in the area attacks and other times I just walk right to one and elbow them in the butt while their buddy watches me before I shoot them in head.  Its kind of funny really.  The main story telling is in slide show format that that is well done and narrated its nice to see Arkane take that approach to story telling instead of the usual animated cut scenes.  Overall I do recommend the game it has its fun moments and it has a unique genre, vampire based horror, that is not often utilized by the industry.",1

137814187,1294810,"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the game.  The staggering amout of bugs, bad AI, empty world with nothing dynamic going on. It tries to be so many genres at once and not being at single one.  Not to mention technical perfomance, its really bad, but that can be fixed.  What about positives, there are not many, but i must say, that some unique weapons like, UV gun, stake launcher and flare gun looks cool and are only interesting weapons.  I iam a massive Arkane fan so this hurts a bit. but what can you do only not to buy it.  Maybe some day it will mediocre game at best. Hope Arkane will survive this fail and start doing game they are good at and actualy wanna make, not this.",0

137815148,1669000,"This level of detail, structure, design, and game play has been a long time coming in my opinion from the games beginning of AoE, this feels like very much a spiritual successor to the original game with so much more micromanagement and enjoyable game play, and mechanics that keep you in the game, but don't overwhelm you with ambiguous rules and consequences, tuned up with a voiced tutorial, and easy to understand help tabs that work on day one, this is the kind of thing I have come to appreciate from Triumph and Paradox over the years.   Age of Wonders 4 hits the nail on the head with their new game, perfect and every way possible, very customizable, not just in the character customization, appearance, culture, race, and organization of your race, but the setting, how your cities develop, your research and spells, and even how you play the game. Its easy to pick up on and play quickly, and anyone that's played a 4X will find their intuitive system and dynamic but simple structure to beginning the game will find no problems diving in head first into this game and finding enjoyment very quickly.   Of the little game I have played, I am enjoying it, my weekend will be fixated in getting to love this new classic reborn into 2023, I was worried I would have no new good games to play this year, but Triumph has made me extremely happy with this game, I am happy to have been dedicated enough with their announcements and games over the years, to finally have a game that makes me feel like my young self again, playing like I used to, and not surrounded by confusion and anguish trying to figure out how everything works.

The strategy aspect is VERY COOL but is very rusty and mechanics/ controls seriously need to be fleshed out otherwise the gameplay is quite enjoyable. I love the scale, graphics, and sense of realism from just about everything. I really do enjoy playing as the aliens I adore how their buildings and economy work. However, I do wish that the aliens had a more unified sense of design. I think all of the alien unit designs are very cool and fit with the general theme but the ""hunter"" for example stands out like a sore thumb on the roster and I believe needs a visual rework, otherwise it's a great unit!

137814611,1824960,"While I haven't beaten the game yet, I have played it enough to get an overall impression. It's been a surprisingly positive one. It feels like there was a strong emphasis on fundamentals. While there are certain things missing, like an expansive physics system, I would rather have fewer feature done with precision than a ton that are half baked.  The features this game does have, feels intuitive. Grabbing my gun is fluid, and I rarely miss my draw. Reloading is nice, as is loading the chamber. All the body object systems work well, with adequately sized grab boxes. I rarely grip the wrong item.   Interacting with world objects feels good. I haven't seen a single janky door or cupboard, twitching on its hinges. Player objects like bolt cutters and drills handle well. The animation of the bolt cutters is smooth and oddly satisfying when cutting through chain. These objects are limited in function, but doing so may have enabled the developers to refine their mechanics.   The audio is also phenomenal, in regards to the atmosphere and tone they were trying to establish. Creaking floor boards and squeaking hinges, with the occasional thrashing of a zombie and a woman's scream just beyond a nearby wall.   To end my ramble, this game has an emphasis on solid mechanics. I could go on about numerous feature that are well implemented: the map/journal/inventory system, the unproblematic performance, and an emphasis to detail. Regarding game logic, some things fall short. You encounter lanterns quite often, yet I am forced to manage my batteries. Why not grab a lantern? My bullets are in limited supply, yet I can't grab this knife on the table. There are other things to nitpick, but after playing so many buggy, disappointing VR games this year, these I can easily overlook. Fundamentals. I appreciate simple mechanics done well.",1
137814738,1269300,Game play loop has potential but if you are on gun duty you aren't really having that much fun since there doesn't seem to be a time you don't want to be shooting.

137816777,1295730,"Surprisingly, the game took three years to produce. It took longer than Sakura Dungeon. (Okay Let's forget Sakura Dungeon was able to make it easily because they plagiarized the game code of Demon Master Chris.)  The game is a series of pain. Low quality of VN parts, minimal character build-up, Male protag taken from their low-grade harem VN, boring battles and meaningless battle mechanics that happen every time when you pass through each tile. and yeah, the UI of this game lags behind the Newgrounds games of the 2000s. I can write these things in a few lines for each category, but I don't think I have to because many disappointed dude have already devoted long reviews.  Well, for me the biggest rulebreaker of the game is that a character I haven't met yet suddenly popped out and hosted her side story event. Jesus Christ, Winged Cloud....",0
137815690,2285500,"First of all, I know how much work went into making this game and that the team that made this game was put together randomly. This also meant that not all members of the team were on the same line, but nevertheless, the project turned out beautifully and is definitely worth a play just because of that.  Next are my pros and cons for Flora Domina. Pros: - It's free, and because of that, I find it very hard to give a negative review, but in this state, I wouldn't give money to play the game. - Beautiful, the aesthetic, the art, the music, the vfx,... - The game is very optimized from what I noticed.  Cons: - There isn't much to the game as of now, but it has potential. The game is very, ""Just use flower bombs to spread as quickly as possible, and we'll see what happens"". - The intro was unclear as to what you should do, I would lock the cards behind a tutorial wall, introducing each card individually. As of now I just skip through all the dialogue or I just start throwing cards around without paying attention to it. - There was still loud ""Machinery"" music playing in the area where the humans started, even though there were none to be seen.  Some suggestions I could think of: - Try to implement a difficulty slider, introducing new AI behaviour - Remove the Janky screenborder movement and add a drag movement where the player can grab the world and move around. - I would love to be able to drag cards to the tile I want them to happen. - Rethink the cards, is flower bomb too OP? Do I really need to place 20 more forests in the end game?...  Conclusion: There is a pretty solid canvas to improve on, I suggest the team to take a step back and look at the overall gameflow of the game, and improve on the core gameplay. The game looks really good and the mechanics work well, but the feeling is not there. The game feels like a chore to finish.",1

I have played for about eight hours and I think I can say I would recommend this game to people. I also understand most people will not prefer this game which is fine. No game is perfect when it launches, every game has bugs when it launches and with redfall its the same. I have found nothing game breaking just kinda funny bugs. over all I am excited to see what else this game will throw at me, I have enjoyed playing it with friends.",1
137815436,1155330,"TLDR: -Gameplay is basically XCOM Light; faster paced, no geoscape, includes exploration and puzzle solving -The presentation of the game gives it its own identity. Good look, cool world, neat characters, decent plot -Had one crash during exploration, no other issues -Overall: very fun, can play in short bursts if you'd like, but you'll probably want to keep playing -Price is right for the amount of game you get, replay value is there, but definitely more limited than XCOM  If you're an XCOM fan, then you won't have much trouble with this game. That's not to say it isn't fun, though. Combat in Showgunners is faster and simpler than what you're probably used to, but it comes as a refreshing change of pace. There are short encounters called ""Ambushes"" that usually last less than a minute and then your longer main encounters which only take up a lot of time and brain power if you're trying to accomplish the optional objectives that will occasionally present themselves. The game is designed to make you feel like a badass instead of a frail team that needs to protect itself and proceed with the utmost precision; in that regard, the lack of challenge wasn't a disappointment. The other side of gameplay is minimal exploration coupled with puzzle solving, which I enjoyed more than I thought I would. There's no geoscape equivalent in this game, so don't expect base building and map management. The story bits are compelling and brief, so there's enough to keep you engaged if you like plot, but not so much that you'll feel like the gameplay halts to feed you more story.   Definitely recommend. Short, fast, sweet, and fun.",1

There are so many fantastic (pun intended) things I could talk about, but the real game changer is splitting the production of units and structures into their own queues. Not only does this speed the game up and feel amazing, but it also allows for some really interesting focus strategies. I can lean into increasing my ""draft"" income to produce units faster, but this usually means that my city does not advance as fast.  The tome and culture systems are amazing as well. Being able to create your own faction by also choosing different traits allows for some really interesting choices. In previous titles, each race basically played a certain way and you had to lean into their intended strategies. In AOW4, you have so much customization that their form really means nothing more than cosmetic appearance. Want evil dark elves that are NOT magic focused? done. How about Magical Orcs? yes!

That's the best thing ever for someone coming from the Sims 3. Also the Steam workshop integration for mods is a big thumbs up for me too.

I can say it is complete enough and playable though.",1
137816509,1566200,"I recommend this game with caveats.  It still needs work, which I think the devs know.  There needs to be much more variety in events, and there needs to be some way to make each run feel more organic and unique, otherwise it's going to start to feel very same-y in a hurry.  There also needs to be a better way to unlock abilities, because there's no way right now that I'm not going to just buy the best stuff and never use anything that doesn't fit my playstyle.  Unfortunately roguelites thrive when you are forced into sub-optimal situations and I'm never just going to do that to myself, so work will need to be done there.    The core game mechanics are very fun (even though one-timers are OP as heck, looks like they really do like NHL 94!) and the bones are there for a world-class title.  It's going to be up to the devs to build on this foundation, taking the best parts from the games that influence them (StS and Hades, etc.) and flesh this project out into what COULD BE a true classic.  I'm glad I bought in and I'm excited to see where things go.",1
137816488,1566200,This game looked amazing. Still might be. But not until some MAJOR difficulty balancing and teammate AI re-work. Absolutely cannot recommend this game until these two issues are addressed.,0
137816353,1566200,"Very good start. I had a lot of fun my first 8ish hours. The next 4, the fun turned to frustration and exasperation.   Gameplay is solid, lets start with that. skating feels good (mostly, a little loose) and there are a lot of highlight reel hockey moments that are very satisfying. laying big hits feels great. scoring sick goals feels great. tic tac toe passing plays feel great.   The bones of this game are incredibly strong. All the game needs now is balancing and content.  SPOILERS BELOW:   Rubber is way too rare a commodity and things are wayyy too expensive. I feel like I would need 100 hours to unlock everything and max my guy. Way too much. Give more rubber in runs (events that give rubber maybe).   Unlocking things and then having to randomly choose between 3 things each run doesn't feel great. I want to play with certain combinations of abilities and superstars but the more I unlock the less likely it is I'll randomly get that combo  Basic AI should be increased. There are perks you can give your players that increase intelligence to a basic level that honestly should just be standard. For example, there's a perk that tells a defenseman to stay between own net and opponent and not let anybody behind them. why do i have to randomly find that perk for basic hockey intellect? should be standard or i should have strategies to select from. obviously devs can code players to act smart but made them bad on purpose. another example is a perk that makes players look for deflections. there's a superstar that is supposed to be good at deflections but he doesn't have the AI perk by default to actually do deflections. so he just skates around randomly. i found it one run and it made him actually usable and he started getting deflection and rebound goals like crazy. give us offensive and defensive strategies, or just increase basic ai to not idiot levels. offensive players dont even crash the net well, skate right past it and shoot into side of net when you pass or they skate to the side of the net you're already on wasting the chance.   Goalie passing needs help. half the time my goalie passes it's off target. half the time my goalie misses a pass it immediately results in a goal by the other time. When the opposing goalie passes it will literally slowly roll between my offense's legs while i'm spamming shoot and nothing will happen. very very lame.  benchwarmers being completely randomized is meh. i would prefer to put the stats where i want them. maybe give us growing stat pools as we progress the game? getting a set of benchwarmers with no speed or no checking is just an instant 'start - end run' and start over. maybe at least give us 10 randomized benchwarmers and let us pick the 3 we want?  events also need work. often they have no choices (should always have a choice) and they just give you something you dont want and wrecks your build. for example, space helmet when i'm running yo-yo. i'd like to move side to side please thanks. as a result, it's pretty much insta-skip events unless it's the very very start of the run or i'm trying to get rabid or something  Currently, i'm putting the game down for a while until there are more updates. The 2 biggest reasons why are:  1. lack of variety.  the runs are all the same right now. same events, same teams, etc etc. Obviously this will get better over time as the game moves through early access. not a huge issue right now. but it gets stale after a while. the challenges should be things like 1v1s vs a legend for a specific perk or a shootout challenge or a skating obstacle course. not just a first to score game. give us things to do.  2. Cultists.  The 2nd zone boss are by far the least fun thing in this game. there is just too much going on. I have now lost to them every single time i've played them and no games have been close, i'm guessing at least 5 losses now, possibly as high as 10. They hit hard, they're fast, they shoot hard, they do everything. on top of that they do magic nonstop. NONSTOP. One of them channels for about 2 seconds and then something happens. the most annoying is one of your players will be frozen in a block of ice for AGES. literally it's like 10 seconds or more. I imagine if you check them while they are casting their spell you can break it, but they channel so quickly i have never been able to do this. also they are often off screen. They also become random 'evil' forms of other superstars with their powerups and abilities. So they get to throw sticks at you and stuff too. also they literally teleport back to D-zone when you enter it. seriously. ALSO, everytime you shoot the puck you drop your stick.  It's just WAY too much. Half of those effects/abilities need to go away. my vote would be the 'evil' forms. honestly they're lame and don't fit the gimmick of cultists in robes. cast time needs to be increased so there's actual counter play. and time frozen in ice needs to be HALVED, at least. There was a moment my last run where i was in the D zone and i had 2 players on screen vs 4 cultists. one of them insta-froze 1 of my dman and then i defended, alone, 1v4 for about 10 seconds before they scored. NO idea where my other 3 players were, doubtless frozen or laying on the other end of the ice.  To summarize, Cultists just do way way way too much. their gimmick idea is neat but the devs got carried away with ideas. ref boss is awesome and does just enough to be annoying but still fun and satisfying to play/beat. cultists are just a nightmare and not fun at all. Haven't even SEEN stage 3 yet because of them. I'm scared to think about how ridiculous the stage 3 teams and boss will be. This was on standard, default difficulty. Devs are fooling themselves if they think this game should be default hard. it's slapstick fun hockey. not FTL.   Last thought, i know the laying on ice for ages thing goes both ways. but it's too long. shouldn't take 10 seconds to get up after a check. Also why no goalie stats? seems obvious to have goalie as side character along for journey that gets better over time as well. weird choice.  I'm very excited to check this game out again in the future and see how it has improved. It's got a good structure and fun gameplay. Really hoping the devs can polish up the balancing and scaling and improve run variety.",1
137815664,1566200,The reffing feels like the playoffs. 10/10,1
137817145,1494420,"Actually wouldn't recommend buying the game immediately on release, but if it gets some more work done on it can definitely recommend.  As it stands now there is unacceptably bad performance past early game and a lot of missing polish on the gameplay side of things.  Has a LOT of potential that I hope comes to fruition.",1
137816274,1494420,"As a master league Starcraft 2 player, I'm a big fan of RTS games. The following review will be based on units and rules in Starcraft 2, which had been proven to be one of the greatet RTS games.     This game is a new form of RTS and much more playable than Starcraft. The most intersting thing is you can move vehicles and reinforcement to teammates as they are playing fps on the same side     First of all, there are some small and simple improvements that developers should have added to the game. By saying simple it is one of those improvements that can be written and added in less than 10 min by any programmer, and I'm a little bit disappointed about the lack of those crucial elements.      1.(VERY IMPORTANT) Coordinate system in RTS mode: Different to traditional RTS, for example Starcraft 2, its not really necessary to add a coordinate system in because everyone controls their own unit, and map is small so the minimap is clearer in terms of where are those units. In Sillica, map is big, icons for units are small and most importantly players can participate in the war in fps mode so a coordinate system is crucial. In gameplay, I realised that its hard to tell friends where am i and where to go just by describing the terrain. SIMPLY add a x-y axis on the map would do the job, or whatever the form of coordinates, so the next time I can say attack A12 and defend C9, send tanks to F3 instead of not knowing what to do.     2.  Reload in FPS mode: There are thousands of fps games out and probably they all have some kind of reload animation or at least some sound effect that shows the gun is reloading. It makes fps more immersive. If there are some time and efficiency issue for the developing of reload animation, at least add some sound when a magazine is empty.     3. Lower accuracy of AI controlled units: Some people might have different ideas but I think it's better to lower accuracy of AI units so human players can feel more involved in game. There could even be a upgrade facility about accuracy and aiming for AI units.     Secondly, there are some long term changes that involves lots of work and effort, but will make the game better and more attractive. Please add them in future updates.     1. Bugs ( which are expected in early release): the most annoying one is the harvesters. They get stuck in places ( I dont know if that's designed intentionally to behave like that to simulate real situations)     2. Air Units. (VERY IMPORTANT)  Everyone will be sooo happy if there are some air units added in, they can take off and land from airport in fps mode, similiar to War Thunder. SOOOOO EXPECTED to see units like jets, carriers and battleships in this game, similiar to Starcraft 2. Same for aliens, they can have flying units countering jets and capital ships.     3. Ammo system. As most fps games there is an ammo limit and when I run out of them I have to go back to base to reload. Heavy units can act as movable ammunition depot. Similiarly, carriers can act as movable airport for reload of air units.      4. upgrade for units. Similiar to starcraft, which you can upgrade attack and defence, it would be useful to add one in.     5. fonts: It is Fine but they could be bigger as not everyone would have a large screen to read small letters     6. A better tutorial (which could possibly be in the plan but i have to mention): I personally didnt use any tutorial or guide as an experienced RTS player but others might need one.",1
137816266,1494420,"Not worth even half of its price. Don't get me wrong - the concept is really great. But execution is just meh. RTS mode is totaly broken due to harvester AI pathfinding, FPS mode is... idk.. Gunplay is dead, weapon reloading animations are nonexistent, alien animations remind me of dayz mod 1.5. I hope developer will make it right, but for now this is definitely a refund.",0

I cant even got a single tackle with my own team. This game is useless and has horrible mechanics. At least when you make a game get some test players before you release it to the public,0

137815652,1423000,"About an hour and a half in and I just finished chapter 2~  I rarely write reviews, however since this game is in its early days of release, I want people to know that they won't regret this decision at all.   For full price, it's worth it. You get: -Full controller support  -A full-voice engaging, cyberpunky story that would pique most peoples interest - Are you going to be a people pleaser, giving everybody what they want? Or are you going to be a hard ass, strict and totalitarian? The choices are up to you!  -A very catchy, futuristic soundtrack - Which is a must when you have ADHD  -Choices actually matter! And you can normally see how it would affect the city in real-time - As response to the comment about how there are too many decisions, please remember that you are an AI program that is managing a city. You SHOULD be making a lot of decisions, the games turns based on them. I personally hate it when I'm playing a game where I'm supposed to be playing an important role and... I don't.  If you don't like games where you have to make decisions, and they were correct that there are a lot of them,  don't buy this game, it wasn't meant for you.  -I honestly have no gripes about the game, all the characters, even the annoying ones, are pretty fleshed out and realistic to the scenarios they're being given. I do wish there was a way to keep track of the choices you've made during a chapter. I have memory issues so I had a hard time remembering what companies they were talking about when they were being called back and I just had to choose the best answer based on the context surrounded by the question. This would be super helpful.  TL:DR? It's a chill with a cool story about an AI that manages a city - Many choices, big and small, and totally up to you - Great purchase, even at full price.   P.S. Big thumbs up to the game developers for making a game that has such high quality graphics and designs - Even if you don't like the story or stories, it is just beautiful to look at and could totally see myself using this game's artwork as one of my backdrops. Adios!",1

137818439,2106910,"English: I love tower defense games and have played many. I think this one stands out a bit from the crowd. In particular, the learning and difficulty curves are excellently balanced, reducing grinding and initial frustration to a minimum. While playing through the campaign, challenges can be completed fairly early on and thus trophies can be earned to make what little grinding that remains more interesting. With more and more game elements (and the aforementioned trophies), the campaign remains exciting and challenging even after exhausting all upgrades. What also convinces me is that the developer of Blue Math is always available to the community (I mean that literally. Seriously Jay, what time do you sleep? ;) ) and is open to ideas and suggestions. I highly recommend the game to any fan of TDGs. Get it and join us on the Discord server where we discuss strategies, successes and flops. :)  Deutsch: Ich liebe Tower-Defense-Spiele und habe bereits viele davon gespielt. Dieses hier sticht meiner Ansicht nach ein wenig aus der Masse heraus. Vor allem die Lern- und die Schwierigkeitskurve sind hervorragend ausbalanciert, was das Grinden und die Anfangsfrustration auf ein Minimum reduziert. Während man die Kampagne spielt, können ziemlich früh Herausforderungen gemeistert und somit Trophäen erworben werden, um das wenige Grinding, das noch bleibt, interessanter zu gestalten. Mit immer mehr Spielelementen (und den erwähnten Trophäen) bleibt die Kampagne spannend und herausfordernd, selbst nachdem man alle Upgrades ausgereizt hat. Was mich ebenfalls überzeugt, ist dass der Entwickler von Blue Math der Community jederzeit zur Verfügung steht (Das ist wörtlich gemeint. Ernsthaft, Jay, wann schläfst du eigentlich? ;) ) und offen für Ideen und Vorschläge ist. Ich empfehle das Spiel jedem Fan von TDGs wärmstens.

137819166,1669000,"Game is prone to crashing, stability issues in general, devs suggest changing settings but I don't know in how many cases this will fix things it released in an unstable condition and they know it, not something that should be encouraged but far too many people are forgiving of this since its the 'industry standard' now.   There's no story campaign like the previous iterations so those coming here for a hand crafted map with an age of wonders related narrative will be quite disappointed.   Unlike the previous titles races are now just skins, unit types no longer decided by race but instead from society providing one of several options, you can apply some trait bonuses which are powerful when stacked but can otherwise be quite underwhelming, coming from AoW 1 to 3 and then 4 the changes went from understandable (1-3) to baffling, it's almost unrecognizable at this point from where we started, it feels less like a sequel more like a complete departure.   The game is good, when it isn't constantly crashing, atm I can't play it at all, but it doesn't feel like Age of Wonders.   A cautious thumbs up for general fans of 4x games, followed by a thumbs down by the disappointment of being unable to play the game for more than 30-60min a time before a crash until it's fixed. Perhaps like other paradox titles all these issues, including perhaps most hopefully the lack of a campaign will be fixed with time, but as it stands I cannot rightly recommend this, buy it on sale when technical issues have been resolved and some DLC have been released, prefferably also on sale.",0
137818893,1669000,"I have played and loved every game in the Age of Wonders series up till this point (including Planetfall, the most polarizing entry in the series), with a combined total of almost 1000 hours in the series across every game. I say this because I want you to understand that I know this series pretty well and consider them some of my favorite games of all time.   I am not exaggerating when I say that this is possibly my favorite game in the series thus far. I need a couple dozen hours more to know for sure, but so far, I'm extremely impressed and having a blast experimenting.  A serious Game of the Year contender, especially within the 4X genre. Easily one of the most ambitious strategy games I can think of due to its complex tome-based magic system and stacking racial enchantments that are visually shown on your units. Being able to fully customize your leaders and the race they lead both is a ton of fun too and reminds me of creating an empire in Stellaris. This game sets out to do a lot, and it succeeds at much of it. Very excited to see where  AoW4 goes from here.",1

I'm a big fan of the series, starting with the old ones and fell in love with shadow magic. I enjoyed age of wonders 3 and planetfall a lot. This new entry has been great so far. The game itself is snappy, fast paced and smooth while still keeping tactical and strategic depth. The race creation gives you alot more replayability, despite the lack of race specific units.

Instead, I'm first greeted with lovely neighbours which made me question whether I wanted to align myself with good, or with evil. So, I chose not to attack and build up relations. Those neighbours then take my kindness for weakness and proceed to claim provinces from me, settle within my regions and ignore my grievances.  Me, not wanting to to accept money for being inconvenienced, had enough and decided to point, laugh and beat the ever loving crap out of my nearest neighbour until they were forced to accept vassalage. I could have destroyed them, but I'm a ""good"" guy, so I let them live under me now.

137821628,2380870,"What an utterly stupid interface. You can't see how much upgrades will cost until you hover over them; and that only works if you can't afford the upgrade. So you have no idea at all what a buy-able upgrade will actually cost. You can only buy one upgrade at a time. The various sort mechanisms don't seem to sort by anything in particular; they just filter the shown items, leaving you to work out the hard way which are more expensive. The 'Other Stuff' panel takes up over a third of the screen; just for the sake of 4 buttons. The display of P/S and P/C don't factor in update multipliers. You can choose to display the full numbers, which after a while become a bit meaningless, or abbreviate them; this gives you only one decimal place of display - so that's soon pretty meaningless too. I'll keep it running to see if anything changes later; but this seriously seems to be an idle/clicker game written by someone who's never played (a good) one before. In its current state, I call 'fake reviews'.",0

The core ganeplay loop is really fun hands down, looting and shooting is satisfying And the big one for me is exploring is so good in this game.   I like th mission layout of this game a great deal so far. The soundtrack is amazing making it feel very alone and dangerous,  I love it.  Now I don't think this game is worth 70 bucks but still allot of fun which no one seems to be talking about.  Cons I have. • poor characters (npc) just awful lip sinc and character gesture and animations. • taking back the neighborhood is a joke! One mission before fighting the vampire? wtf. • no way to store weapons? Come on! Those are pretty much it.  I still think the game is worth playing wether it's on gamepass or on sale.

I can't tell if this game will be fun and engaging once it is fully fleshed out and patched, but right now it is buggy and incomplete. Vampires that are non-responsive and can't be killed, NCP sliding across the ground instead of walking, terrible AI on enemies, characters that don't interact except to say ""Hi!"", and many other annoying issues.

As for graphics, I'm running on a 1070 graphics card and I'm still running the graphics on high and achieving 40-50 fps. With some massive fps drops that occur when I'm running discord in the background. I believe they need to tweak the enemy AI for better combat interactions, because it can feel dull and very silly at times. Finally, I really want some balancing for coop, because coop feels too easy on midnight difficulty, having four people makes the game too much of a drive by in comparison to solo. Overall, I believe the game should have been released as an early access, and have a much lower price tag. Game is fun if you're okay with simplistic fps looter shooter gameplay, and if you're okay with bugs and low graphics quality. Soundtrack is good though.",1

There are some major issues that you can read about in other reviews and in discussions, AI balance is broken (in standard you win matches by 4-0 and then lose 1-7 in boss fight, in casual you beat same boss 11-1) Player goalie could be replaced by cardboard cutout and if you want to unlock things you have to play on casual to get more pucks sooner  BUT - despite all that 4h on the clock, campaign passed and I know I'll go back to this for many more hours. I see comments where this game is compared to NHL by EA - sure, both are about hockey but those are 2 different games entirely and I do enjoy both",1
137821889,1566200,Even if you don't like hockey there is something super satisfying about linking passes at a high rate of speed and finding the back of the net. The game can provide a great challenge so making plays and utilizing talents and artifacts is extremely rewarding and it feels like your knowledge and experience matters as you learn what each power-up does. The controls felt intuitive for me to pickup and they're fairly basic in terms of sheer quantity and complexity. If you have issues with control layout I think there is also a way to change the layout via steam :). Anyways long review short- Great game so far 4.1/5,1

Loved the art on them!

The gameplay looks a bit weird, the movement of the character feels like he is injured or stepping in mud of how he walks but not sure if it's intentional or not for be more slower and feel more the intensity of the fights.

The worst part is that most of the issues don't even manifest themselves until several hours into the game. The AI is some of the worse I've encountered.

I'm only about 2/3 of the way through the story missions, but I hope the map is bigger than the area you start in.   At best, this game is 25-30% done.

But I remember a certain Fallout 4, who's bugs included not being able to leave the vault at the start of the game on launch. This game has no such bugs, maybe a couple minor performance hiccups. And all of that will get better. If people are crying about limited content... Fair. This is Arkane's weakest title to date. I feel there's a few reasons for that, But these issues are honestly not enough to make it a bad game imho. At the end of the day, Arkane is known for one thing I think above all. Fluid, rewarding combat. And this game delivers that like a semi. It's not jam packed with unique features like most of their previous titles. But it's a fresh, new open world co op shooter. And a decent one, which we haven't had in a while it feels. If you're looking for a perfect title that has years of updates and development, with no bugs or performance problems, go play Skyrim...

137826300,1669000,"Nice update to the AOW formula. Took a little from Planetfall, with districts instead of just tiles to build on, which I like. Streamlines the process. Not entirely sold on the art style, but, that is a personal preference. Not as clear as the old art. Also, I miss the little story excerpts you see from the older games when you examine units. I get the story setup in this game kind of makes it nonsensical due to all these realms being different. Missing some ease of use too, as you have to do more work to see what upgrades your city and units have.  All in all, it is pretty great. No crashes on my laptop, and the customization is huge. You can start with many different traits and cultures but can easily morph into others as the game goes. Want dark culture but love the production of a materium culture? Just start as an industrial faction and then get the tomes of the dark. Now my industrious humans are great at production and gets undead perks.

One ""out of sync"" has led to dead session when one player is in the battle and second one is outside of it - and it was longest session yet ....  . What's with latest  PC releases.   Haven't played Single player long enough to get opinion on it. But if you plan to play mostly multiplayer - wait till patches . For now it's almost unplayable .Will update review if they fix it in coming weeks. If not gonna try to refund - game was bought for multiplayer only ( planetfall was one of the best fun i had playing and experimenting with bilds in coop ) and if it doesn't work what's the point.

And the siege system gives your army a response time to defend your territory.  Multiplayer is unstable BUT every issue my group has had is fixable with everyone rejoining, only takes a minute.

I'm not a fan of the automatic pokecheck; it would be nice if I could press a button to pokecheck instead. But I understand this probably won't happen.  I guess I would just like to see both improved so the game feels more seamless.  Just an idea, but I think ""reversing"" checking and pokecheck would be fun. So the check button now becomes the pokecheck button, and using your thumbstick to go into a player delivers a hit. Possibly even adding a secondary control option with more ""modern"" controls would be cool. Again, I know this probably wouldn't be added, but I figured I'd throw it out there.  Everything feels just a little delayed, imo.

The games architecture also reminds me of Slay the Spire where you choose your path during each level with rest stops, challenges, etc. You also collect 'rubber' during your runs which you utilize to purchase new abilities and characters.

137830331,2325900,"This is a really fun take on a Rogue-like / card builder / city sim. At first it is really easy but as your village grows into a city it feels like a balancing act of the resources. The way you design your city has pros and cons for the entire game, which can be frustrating but also is rewarded at every turn by the many different offerings of card. This game really delivers on the ""I just need this one card to pull it all back from the brink"". Down in faith or gold and with one card, well placed, could fill the coffers. Of course this comes at the cost drafting another card in its place.   I played the demo of this game and was surprised that the entire game was available during the demo, which I beat and enjoyed thoroughly. I was equally surprised when the game came out that it was free and I could continue my last run (from the demo). I have maybe 4 hours of time from the demo split across 3.5 runs.  The game play is as fast-paced as you hit end turn, there is very little micro-managing, and nearly all of the failures you will  face are surmountable and caused by your own decisions.

They don't reinvent the wheel when it comes to story. Which is okay. But it misses something. Having a Max quality gun right from the start....Balancing. The world feels empty. There is almost no enemies.  Most of decor cannot be ""interacted"" with. What i mean by that, is destroying. Which is a feature most open world have nowadays. Most quest are fetch quest which gets tiring really fast.  It feels like the people who made that game were just there to ""fill up colors in a coloring book"". This game has no soul.

137829117,1294810,"Usually I wait till I beat a game before I review it but being that there are thousands of negative reviews coming in for this recently released game with people having only played a few hours of it, I’d thought I’d add my positive review now to help balance it all out! This review is based on single player alone and with around 8 hours of play only.   PRESENTATION:   Game looks fantastic! It’s colorful and dark at the same time. Love the mix of incredible illustrative animated art cutscenes when you select a new main mission and the stunning small town neighborhoods with the mysterious setting of floating static water and blood pools. The 3D characters look great. The illustrative animation intro to the game is stunning.     Story is interesting enough at this point, with cultists following a “Hollow Man” and helping the vampires out for some reason. There is a mystery of how the vampires were created and as you move around the map, you get proximity dialogue from the vampires and cultists, which is interesting and scary at the same time. Along with occasional announcements you can hear from the Hollow Man, with a beastly voice that helps set the scary mood. Artifacts, notes and journals you find throughout the open world and doing side and main quests, moves the narrative forward. The character you choose also from time to time will spit out some dialogue, contributing to knowing them and personalizing the story. Killing vampire animations are brilliant. Sounds are everywhere and contribute to the deathly environment you are in. Day/Night and weather cycles are executed well and the game greatly increases its frightening mode when it’s dark. Overall, developers have created a very beautiful, spooky, immersive environment.      GAMEPLAY:  I like how you can only have one main mission selected at once to focus on, giving you some choice in the branching main quest. Mission menus are done well and you can clearly see main quests from side and safe house quests. Weapons are fun to use and varied and upgrades to them work well. I like how easy it is to compare different weapons. Fast travel is possible on the smallish map and movement and fighting is very much like Aracane’s previous title Dishonoured. Though the jumping doesn’t feel as well executed in Redfall. I’ve only done a few special power upgrades at this point from the skill tree, but seems to be executed well and gives a greater sense of progress. Though this is where some issues with the game can be highlighted.   I haven’t really felt the need to use my character’s special powers because of how bad the AI is in this game. I’m currently playing on the highest difficulty you can start with, which is Midnight. Can be challenging when you get attacked by multiple vampires at once. But the cultists are way too easy and seem clueless, doing things like running right past you instead of shooting. I’ve also come across a few vampires that are just floating in the sky and you can come right up to them and get the first shot right in their face. Are they sleeping …? I have died a couple times so, on this difficulty at least, you will still get some challenges. Still needs to be seen how the difficulty scales. Would have been nice to have the highest difficulty unlocked right from the beginning for more of a challenge for those who like that, which seems to be the locked “Eclipse” mode. Also to mention, there are many things to pick up throughout the game to get some XP, ammo, health etc. Too much of it and most seem a bit pointless collecting, or at least not exciting to pick up. Especially when you are so easily killing everything and just don’t need that much health and ammo around to pick up. It’s almost like there was supposed to be more challenges and things to kill but the game is missing them. Certain objects are also highlighted that you can shoot and they would explode to help you take out a group of villains but the game is not challenging enough to need to use them.    PERFORMANCE:  I’m on an RTX 4090 and i9 13900k. At 4K and with DLSS on and set to quality mode of DLAA, I’m getting an average fps of 160. Every few minutes I get a very brief stuttering happening in game play. I’ve had the game freeze on me once and certain things like I can’t search bags that are meant to be searched, vampires frozen, and when the game restarts, my main gun has changed to some other gun. Other than that, the game has run well.    VERDICT:  The presentation in this game is fantastic and overall the level design is executed well. There are some serious issues with the AI and the difficulty level is too easy and these need to be fixed. These, along with the high price for the game, are the biggest areas that are bringing the points down. Still, an enjoyable experience, at least in single player mode.     6/10 - Okay",1

([i]I mean, I guess the new rats eat the old ones, so that kind of checks out, but still[/i])  They also could have drastically different Alignments based on seemingly random chance.

137828136,1669000,"I came into the AOW series with 3 loving role playing Dreadnought Humans crusading across the map and showing the world magic is redundant when you have faith, steel and crucially, gunpowder.   AOW4 is an amazing game and one of the few I felt no issues getting the season pass for. Its strength is its variance and replayability, which I think other 4x titles really struggle with.  As mentioned about my AOW3 game time I loved the game but rarely did I ever finish one. I often got bored after snowballing too easily across the map as the tech tree often fizzled out and build queues in cities were resorted to just pumping out units like a 3D printer.  What AOW4 does differently, is it incentivises me to complete it via the cosmetic and power changes to your faction, it evolves in so many ways I can tell that was a core focus of this game. The unit roster is smaller but the possibilities are far more. By far my favourite system is a persistent pantheon, like you are assembling your own dysfunctional Greek house on Olympus. All faction leaders you win with get to ascend and return in future games. Cosmetic gear gets unlocked and new realm choices appear, it has amazed me no other game has come up with this concept before (that I have come across at any rate).   To finalise, the combat is a lessor focus but still enjoyable. I find it unfortunately limiting only 6 units per army but like you can stack many together to make huge battles occur. It has a learning curve and is deceptively deep with unit abilities and synergies but is something that without the strategic map would be very hollow.   If I had any criticism is that the cultures seem too bare minimum. Where is my gunpowder units Triumph!? But honestly 6 seems a little low as they do determine the units and at least initial asthetic of your factions. AOW3 did only have 7 and one was dlc so I am hopefuly more will be added in the coming months.   TLDR: Buy the game it has the best replay value of out any 4x title i have come across.",1

Those were the chapters that I found the most accurate, I would also like to point out the tunnel metaphore which occurs throught the entire game it backs up the statement at the begining of the game which says that end of every tunnel feels like the beggining of another one.",1

137833968,2315940,"[spoiler]   Pros:  Love the action platforming gameplay, which I think is especially important since it's the bread and butter. Visuals and audio really sell the aesthetic, love the more tonal aspects of the sound design w harpsichord, xylophone, etc. I love the skeleton companions and I will protect them at all costs. Love how the different sheep compliment each other in the late-game. Ungodly amount of content for a game made by students in less than a year  Critique/areas for improvement: I found it disorienting when enemies would pop in with no vfx nor animation to accompany it I think the firepit sound design could use a little more ""body"" (could barely hear the fire when I moved the character next to it) Same goes for the sound when a sheep hits a target, when an enemy hits the player character, I think it could use less ""click"" and more ""oomph""/""smack"". Sound when the player character decapitates a large enemy sounds more like a bone crunch/apple bite, could use more slicing/gory/juicy sound When the house uprooted, was expecting to hear more rocks/dirt gravel but the sound I heard seemed more like a reverb-y ""balloon pop"". Same goes for the destructible walls. Obviously, the balloon pop worked for those balloon-lizard enemies. The upgrade menu sounds seemed to be doing a weird reverse panning effect which I found to be distracting (I'd hover on the left-side icons and hear sounds in my right ear) Small QoL thing: Would love to be able to back out of the pause menu with the ""B"" button on controller. I found myself accidentally killing my sheep a lot by spamming RB, not sure why that is a feature. Would have preferred that they stay alive and/or replenish to ten when I do that instead of killing them all off and respawning all 10. I found myself switching to kb+m due to the complexity and verticality later in the game. UI switching for controller/kbm should happen based on input used, not when my controller turns off. I also found the binding of the special attack to the ""1"" key to be a strange choice (""F"" could be a good replacement?) Corners of the skybox took me out of the experience. Serious difficulty spike in the late game. Combat encounters are really long and Baba Yaga's House has an insane, destiny-raid-boss amount of health. Didn't see any health pickups in this boss fight. Health pickups felt under-powered and while not a high priority, could use audio feedback when picked up   [/spoiler]",1

It's unbelievable that we are served this. I usually don't buy AAA games on launch, but Arkane always delivered good games so I decided to trust them this time.   While it was obvious that this game will be different than other Arkane titles and would not follow the immersive sim design philosophy so that we would not get another Prey or Dishonored, it still seemed that this game had good and innovative concept behind it and it would have a quality of its own. I mean, Arkane making a game in a small abandoned town full of vampires? Sign me in! It was literally the opportunity for Arkane to realize their take on Ravenholm level from HL2 into a full blown game. So I was ready to consider this game without comparing it to previous Arkane titles. But this game breaks on practically every front.   Optimization is the least of its problems. Yes, it is terrible, but you can play it on a reasonable computer on  40-60 fps. Enemy AI is very basic, and that problem is more obvious when you are in open areas. Gameplay mechanics are also very bland and underutilized. There's very little reason to use any abilities in combat when just shooting enemies in the head will do a better job 99% of the time. Also, your ability to use the environment to your advantage in combat, is very limited, almost non-existent.  Enemy placement is also very bizarre and is probably my biggest gripe with the game. To illustrate. I would stroll an empty street during the sunny day and just find a vampire levitating in a park near the road. Just standing there until I get close enough. Why? Game often feels like some fanmade map or a mod for some other game with random placement of enemies. Vampires are such a cool idea, and the opening scene where they hide from the sunlight is so cool. But then you realize that sunlight plays no role. Apparently there is an eclipse, but that is a BS excuse. The best encounters with vampires are in closed areas and dark corners, and that is where this game shines. I expected there would be some system where vampires would only walk freely during the night, and during the day they would hide. Also, its very easy to kill those vampires, so they are not so scary and just become tedious to deal with.  Despite all of this, I can see that there was a great game in here somewhere. In the closed areas where the game is more focused there is that sweet Arkane environmental storytelling. Case in point: the opening level in the boat. You navigate through tight corridors, find a note about a hidden pistol in the car, look for medical supplies find shortcuts to utilize that sweet looping level design.  But then the game decides to throw all of that away for the most part. There are some segments here and there where the good game/level design resurfaces, but they are very rare. Also, the town of Redfall is actually very well made, and there's a lot of ways you can navigate around and explore. The problem is, you barely have any reason to do so. Once again, this looks like some (very well made) map for Garry's Mod.  My biggest regret is that I gave this game a chance for longer than 2 hours, so my refund request will probably be rejected. Maybe after months and months of patching this might start to resemble a decent game, but I wouldn't hold my breath.",0

137833471,1669000,"From the perspective of a life long Master Of Magic fan, I have to say this game is doing a lot of things right. I will first go over the bad stuff, since there is not very much of it. And then go over some general positives.  THE BAD  I am playing this game solely on my GPD Win Max 2. And the performance at 15W is a little sluggish, even with everything at low or turned off. The 2D Strategic map runs like butter, but the 3D Strategic map will be generally sluggish. To be fair in a Turn Based Game its very easy to ignore, but if you expect it to run smoothly be warned.  I think the performance is hindered by the graphical options which are a little lackluster for a PC Game. Something as simple as dedicated fullscreen mode, or the ability to set the resolution manually are missing features/options that feel like rather odd design choices.   The Render Slider IMHO is horrible tradeoff where anything below 100% becomes excessively blurry, with a weird dithering LOD effect. Let me lower the resolution, and have more effective ways to maybe go as far as disabling trees, or 3D features sur a resources replacing them with flat icons.  There could even be some effort put into allowing people to operate their empire while viewing the 2D Strategic view. I find it strange that when I click on a town in the 2D view, I have to zoom in in order to see its city overview screen. Should be able to issue build and move orders from this screen.  If you want your turns to go buy faster on a low end machine, zooming out to 2D view before hitting end turn will help a bit.  THE GOOD  The thing that I loved the most about Master Of Magic was coming up with Custom Wizard Builds, and trying to push for a certain theme or playstyle that I felt like exploring. Sure it could result in some rather OP builds, but I felt it fit with the whole Power Fantasy Wizard feeling I was going for in the first place.  I dont have enough experience with this game yet to see if the same level of OP could be reached. But from the titles of some AO4 videos Ive seen come out. I think there are already some extremely powerful builds that people have found. This is great for people who like to not only finetune their playstyle, but exploring different ones. It gives the game a lot of replayability which is very important for these types of games.  The way that they broke down races into their appearance, followed by faction, social and other traits makes for an interesting approach to customization that goes a bit deeper than other games in the genre offered before. This is compounded by the rather intricate Tome system with some minor/major changes you can apply to your race/faction. If you take the time to look at the tomes, their spells and unit enchanements. You can surely find a Goldilocks combination that will feel just right for you. It could feel totally overwhelming for some though. Just take your time with it!  The city management and expansion feels refreshing! Great combinations of incity buildings, with improvements you build around your cities. Some of which depend on your tome or racial choices which feeds back into the crazy levels of customization. Definitely a unique take on terrain exploitation when comparing to the older days of MOM.  Another really unique thing is the patheon system. Allowing you to level up your pahteon in its own skill tree. At first I was disapointed as the first skills are related to cosmetics it seems. But afterwards you start unlocking things like unique traits that give you even more customization options to build the craziest fantasy race you could ever dream of! I cant tell for sure. But it feels like this is the first time we are getting some kind of progression that goes beyond just making your wizard stronger while playing a game. You can unlock things to use in future games. I like it!  Overall I am beyond excited to keep digging into this game, as well as see what the upcoming expansions will bring to the table. Not to mention the amazing mods the saints of the internet will create.  No need to rush and buy it. Go look at some YT playthroughs or go read the wiki. If it resonates with you give it a shot! I think this has the potential to become another staple in the Fantasy 4X genre.",1

They are working on fixing the minor issues and I have good faith in that they'll deliver.",1
137832164,1669000,"Mixture between Civ 6 and Total war warhammer, but lacks the progression and strategy of Civ and real time combat of total war. The only selling point this game has over either is that you can customize your nation(even though many customization options are locked behind progression for some reason, you start of with one leader origin and unlock others later which is moronic WHY???), but even that is in the end quite meaningless as all alterations and race modifications you make during a campaign get reset after a match. There is no carry over of traits ( excluding hero progression which is trash cosmetics mostly).   Just play Civ or if you like the real time combat go play total war. Or better yet play crusader kings...  This is just a mediocre middle ground between the two  Here is a list of complaints after 5.6 hours that I could be bothered to play:  -The claiming system is annoying, it is a juiced up version of people getting pissed in civ for settling too close. Sucked in civ, sucks here even more  -Trying to click on specific units and moving them around to specific areas on the map is annoying, the world is not hex based like CIV is yet the world has massive differences in terrain. Trying to select an army to move it around is annoying af. You have a flying unit, you cant click on the sprite you have to calculate the terrain below the sprite which is tad harder than it should. Highlight the ground better.  -the combat system tries to one up civilization yet falls straight on its face. Instead of having a mix of melee, ranged and siege units you just fill your armies with the highest tier units possible to get max amount of military power. And then you just simulate the result. Even if the battle is 50/50 at most you will lose one or two units which is pretty much nothing. There are no pyrrhic victories which the system desperately needs to function, bigger stack wins always doesnt matter if it is all supports as long as they are high tier, for 0 cost to you. Not thought through.  -Cities expand in visually incredibly unseemly fashion and it is simply not as fun to manage as it is in CIV 6. Planning things out where to put improvements etc. doesnt exist here. The city management here is quite laughable just spam spam spam all the buildings for points you need doesnt matter what. There is no fixing this.   -The roleplaying, this games only selling point is completely ruined by the fact that nobody cares who you are or what you are about. The fairy elfs that love nature and kissy face trees and whatever will have no problem with the most evil necromancers as long as the necromancers dont start wars. OR GOD FORBID, take lands the fairy princesses claimed. That is the greatest crime of all unimaginable. But resurrecting babies for your slave armies yeah no biggy. Your race and traits are completely meaningless(and the buffs and nerfs are completely pointless too they affect nothing in any significant way)  -The story is a series of missions that last on average 50 turns. the missions have a plot of ""bad guy is doing bad stuff and it is your duty to stop him!"" But I am 100 evil the most evil crazy lunatic of them all why would you ever ask me to do this??? This is fail RP. There is no evil storyline, you have one story line and you will follow it to the end whether it fits your rulers character or not. FAIL RP. Customizing a character does not equate roleplaying. Wake up.  -The story missions also play out in similar fashion, build up army and conquer cornpops castle. Zerg rushing is completely viable once you realize this. There is no point to starting settlements or anything of the sort. Just build up 4 armies and send them to enemy capital ASAP for free win. And no, you wont miss out on epic gameplay if you do.   -There is no point focusing on science, culture or war and go for that victory condition because you can just keep spamming buildings as much as you like. But I never even played the sandbox so maybe I am completely mistaken but it sure didnt seem like it from the story missions. They say every playthrough is different but frankly it looks to me that every playthrough will be always equally basic because there really isnt any differences in things you could do. Just build the same buildings every time and annex the mine provinces as soon as you can. Bleh  What I cant wrap my head around is why these 4x devs wont add lineages. I know some total wars have had this, but give the ability to marry allies or nobles to get heirs and as your leader ages those heirs will become rulers. Similar to Crusader kings, but in a 4x setting. But no, instead lets just have this immortal guy in charge that will lead for eternity.   ""Wonder why people think our game is kinda lame"" Because you did nothing new (other than the race customization which again, maybe an hour of content). It just isnt that good.  If you are planning on playing, skip the missions and go straight to a sandbox. Oh yeah the maximum amount of AI is less than 10 hahahahahahhaha Babys first strategy game over here  But if you have never played civilization total war or any strategy games and are interested in this stuff you might like it. But just buy total war shogun 2, CK2/3 or civ 6 if you would like to get this. They are better. CK2/3 especially for roleplaying",0

Same sort of unit just different coloured damage, etc. On the plus side the base game is solid, only some UI issues such as no city overview.

Anyway I love this game, really takes me back to the days of playing NHL 99 on N64 with my best friend, fueled by nothing but Capri Sun and microwaved quesadillas. This game is Early Access and I already enjoy it so I'm very eager to see how this could get better. As a lifelong fan and USA Hockey official I really enjoyed all the lingo, references, and inside jokes. Great stuff. Gameplay is almost like if there had been an NHL Blitz realeased alongside NFL Blitz.   If you are having trouble progressing a.k.a. not lighting the lamp enough, I recommend Kelly Jelly as a linemate, her high speed stat allows punishing body checks even at her small size, and of course frequent breakaways. Body check as much as you can, and try not to pinch in any of the three zones- the cpu doesn't seem to know what do when you have a strong backcheck going the entire game. Outlet passes up the boards are very effective in this game, and avoiding bodychecks can be done with a quick Savardian spin-o-rama. Works 50% of the time, every time.",1
137832500,1566200,"This is if an arcade version of NHL '14 and Hades crossed paths. I didn't expect to love it as much as I do. There is a lack of hockey representation on PC for a decade plus.

137832447,1566200,"Actually; I do not recommend this game at the moment but thumbs up for the effort so far also recognizing the game is in early access...  There is no offsides or icing in this game so far.  I'm not sure if its to be added or you have to ""level up"" to earn them...    ...either way...  its what causes me to say ""f**k this game"" and shut if off.    If this is something that you have to level up to then I stand by my ""f**k this game"".    That being said, this might be the best hockey game on Steam which is a sad embarrassing state of affairs.  I used to live in San Diego and fell in love with the fish tacos sold out of shacks.  Now that I'm in NYC I look for a proper  baja fish taco which are available but everybody in NYC has to change it slightly to put their own ""signature"" on what a baja fish taco is; thereby ruining it.    I just want a classic baja fish taco without any deviation the same way I just want a classic ice hockey game without feeling like I have to grind for 10 hours before feeling like its fun to actually play the hockey part.",0

There's definitely some balance issues, but I'm ok with it, it's early access. My first couple runs were quite challenging on standard, so I dropped to casual just to get a feel for the game. Casual was challenging enough to still be fun but still be able to beat it. However, the game became pretty easy once I figured out that rest areas are just really good. +4 to all player stats? It actually makes the game progressively easier as your team stats increase. I haven't tried on the hardest difficulty yet so I could be wrong.

In prospector/Arena mode all perfect 120 fps.  Tough to play with vehicles considering you get pretty much no zoom mode or FPS mode, if you're in a big tank and aim at certain angle you won't see anything because of how massive the tank itself is.

137833455,1494420,"The game has potential, but its also overwhelming at the moment.  There is no tutorial, so your first hour will be frustrating, be prepared for that.  The alien race is more melee oriented within their first evolution, so you will more often than not, be able to get a kill against any human rifleman until some research is done.  As an alien, you can take control of units 'produced' by pressing E (don't go looking for a building to change your loadout) There is also no fall damage with aliens!  The human race is what you would expect from a Starship Trooper game mixed with Dune 2000 RTS  There is no possibility to change the keybinds, so if you have an AZERTY keyboard, you are forced to play with English layout enabled via Windows for the moment.

What a perfect way to encapsulate this game.  This is a very unexpected breakout into a genre that hasn't seen innovation or experimentation for an extended time. As it currently stands the game is buggy, laggy and has a fair bit of jank to it. Let me clarify, I do not mean to put it down for these factors. All of that combined, and I still genuinely enjoyed it.  The full on combat between the factions is a loud and bombastic experience. Someday, this game could be what the RTS-FPS genre really needs. A fresh adventure in a long quiet corner of gaming.  As it stands, here are the things that Silica needs to work on: Faction balance AI pathing Map clutter, cover and livery design Visual bugs General Performance Faction design and individuality  Like many of the best Bohemia Interactive titles, the bones of a great experience are present.  What this game needs is support from a healthy community that understands this will take TIME.  I would NOT recommend this game if you are expecting a full experience.  This is still very early on in its development cycle, and absolutely fits the description of ""Early Access"". You will experience game breaking bugs and performance issues.

I am not recommending you buy it for what it is now, but it has so much potential to be a classic and redefine the minimum line for a great RTS.  A few titles have had a rts fps and have failed to really deliver on the concept.    In short this game is missing alot and needs elements from: - aoe2 city building with investing workers into an economy and needs walls (the building is mundane and feels weird by just kind of phasing into reality)  - halo wars neutral AI to encourage more of a focus on economy and not a early game rush and maybe encourage a push for more resources (right now the map is pretty much just open with nothing to contest) - supreme commander forged alliance type of tech system and progression would be a great medium for combat (the combat is wait 20 seconds to make a single infantry unit, and tech up while 9 guys are being made, then when they are out you can push out the next 9 guys of that tier)  Those are a few of the games I could think of that could really make this game great.

Don't buy if you want something with tons of depth.  Audio is mixed...a lot of SFX that are obviously pitched up or down to try and make them fit, but don't hit the mark. Gunplay feels unsatisfying with insanely long TTK Have you ever wanted to just run for minutes across a desert only to get shot by a vehicle? Now you can. AI Pathing? not great Vehicle controls? Pretty non-responsive.  RTS/commander seems to be the main draw, as is the scale of things in FPS view.  Unfortunately your FPS experience is entirely dependent on what your commander provides to you, so if you're stranded in the VERY LARGE maps, you're going to have to run forever or hope someone comes along to kill you.

137833843,1824960,"Gameplay/Let's Play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzDFQhYIzos  This is a pretty solid VR survival horror experience, reminiscent of the original Resident Evil.  There's guns and ammo, a flashlight with batteries you need to replace, quest items such as bolt cutters, screwdrivers, keys and keycards, actual puzzles, a healing sprayl, a Resident-Evil type of map and also save points, which in this game are hotel books, instead of typewriters.  The combat can be quite intense, sometimes resulting in an initial jump scare and you trying to center all shots while the zombies stagger left and right, and lunge towards you. Then you have to reload by popping the magazine out of the gun, stuffing a new one in and pulling the top back, all while the zombies charge or attack you. Fortunately you can punch them (with or without gun), so they back off for a second or two. The whole thing takes a bit of practice, but you should be able to reload pretty fast after a while.  While you can open a traditional inventory screen, you also wear a belt with a few bags, where you can pull out healing spray refills, ammo or batteries, depending on what you have in your other hand. A very convenient mechanic, as sometimes you want to refill your health spray/pistol/flashlight REALLY fast.

137835328,2086140,I like this. It gives me something to grind. It also has a lot of build variety. It's almost like an idle RPG without the endless monetization.,1
137833848,2086140,"...Its not bad? The upgrade system in between runs is really cool and is pretty unique, but a lot of the upgrades are just boring. Most things you are grabbing are just +Crit chance and +damage. Every now and then you'll get something cool like every bullet pierces enemies or every bullet sets things on fire, but every upgrade in between that is boring and lackluster. The amount of currency you get every run is also piss poor, and I've seen other reviews say the same thing. Sometimes you just take random damage that you have no clue where its coming from.  I'm probably gonna keep playing, but there are definitely better games of the same genre.",0
137835818,1277920,"Bottom line up front: This game launched too soon. Sit on this in your wishlist for a while and see what it looks like in 6 months to a year.  I won't go into detail on the launch issues because lets be real, its an MMO. There were bound to be huge issues. If multi-million dollar companies with 20 years of MMO experience still mess up a launch then there was no way a few dudes from an Indie studio would pull it off. But for reference about half my current time played (36 hours) is loading screen due to launch issues.  Having said that, the games starting experience is fun to play and definitely worth paying the 10 bucks once (its a subscription game). I would easily rate the first 10 hours of play as a 9/10 experience. The Solitary Isles (the first real map) are full of stuff to discover and things to do. The key word system for NPC discussion is cool, the crafting is interesting, and the entire zone is filled with content.  HOWEVER, once you reach the mainland the game is completely barren of content. I spent close to 6 hours exploring the mainland over the last 2 days and there is almost nothing to do except wander around looking for something to do (and failing to find it).   For starters, I only found 5 spawn points of hostile monsters. 5 total, in 6 hours of exploration. Of those 5 groups only 3 of them were level appropriate to give me experience and any sort of challenge at level 11. In addition to the monsters I found maybe 4 spawn points of neutral mobs who were completely trivial.  I found 1 dungeon, Lair of the Exiles (designed for 5 players), which was waaaaay off the beaten path. As a tank I was able to solo one trash mob at a time and I think the dungeon would be great for a small group of players (if they can find it). The only reason I found it is because I was searching for mobs to kill for a task board mission (more on that below).  I found a handful of small towns by following the various roads on the map, but there was no content there other than mission board requests to turn in x amount of resource or kill x monsters. I accepted a mission from the town of Dawnrock to kill 20 wasps but was never able to find any wasps. The quest text said nothing about a location or even a direction and I made ever-expanding patrols around the town but never found the wasps (I completely searched the area between the mountains and rivers around the town).  Most of the NPCs you come across on the mainland are basically scenery. They have first and last names and some share the same last name and even have a house assigned to them, which implies some decent planning. However, none of the NPCs have any dialogue. No quest text, not even a greeting. The only NPCs that actually interact are vendors or skill trainers. The rest might as well be flowerpots for all they add to the world.  Exploration, the one actual form of content currently on the mainland, is often frustrating. There are loads of terrain features which block your movement such as rivers and mountains. You can traverse some hills but not others which leads to an obnoxious and tedious session of terrain humping as you search for a possible way to climb a mountain (in the vain hope that there might be content at the top). This wouldnt be so bad if there were other things to do in the valleys between mountains or along the riverbanks. But there isnt. So you basically have to wander aimlessly, often humping the hills to move around, or you can follow the paths to more towns bereft of content.  In conclusion: I want to love this game and I did love it for the first 10 hours. But the decision to launch with no content on the mainland is baffling to me. This game is a hard pass until they spend significant time fleshing out the mainland. I dont expect it to be as content dense as the starting isle but the current mainland situation is frankly embarrassing.  Further, the choice to make this a subscription game kind of blows my mind. I get that it keeps out the trolls to an extent but I find it hard to believe that a handful of devs will churn out enough content to justify a recurring expense, especially in a world where there are dozens of existing F2P MMOs with years of content already on the market.",0

137837352,1669000,"I found this game dull, dry, and unenjoyable. But if you love AoW then you'll love this, or if this is the first time you're playing the game, you may get your money's worth. For me, this is too expensive for the limited experience. I'd buy on sale for $15 in a year after its had some improvements made.  The main problem is the same as AoW3: It's boring. There's no spark. There's no chemistry. I played a lot of AoW2: Shadow Magic but I think I'm burned out on it. I came to AoW3 with some misgivings about the unit design and other changes but since I'd gotten a lot of play time out of its predecessor I bought it. I stopped playing within a week. In hindsight, AoW2 Shadow Magic ended with me having no enthusiasm for the game. It's a tough call. How do you rate a game that you got a lot of hours out of but are sick of by the end? Good? Bad? Well, for me, it's asking whether I got 100 hours of gameplay out of it? For AoW2 I think the answer is yes. Whether I'm sick of the game at that point or not is the difference between ""good"" or ""great"". And the time threshold changes based on experience and price. There are certainly cheap games I only play 50 hours but I get a lot of enjoyment and I recommend.  The best lateral comparison I can make to my AoW burnout are the Civilization games. I have not nor will ever buy another Civilization Game because I'm full up on it from the days of Civilization 4. It just doesn't grip me anymore, especially for the price point.  So why did I even buy AoW4? Because I think the changes they've made to simplify things were a move in the right direction. Why did I refund? Because the game is *still* too tedious for me, especially the combat. One friend said he finished his first fight without really knowing what he was doing but ""brute forced"" it. That to me cuts to the heart of the problem with all of AoW. The combat is too detailed and technical without adding enjoyment. I honestly think a simpler combat system would work better for me. When you find yourself not intuitively understanding the rules for flanking, counterstrikes, etc. then what's the fun? That's not to say you *can't* understand it. However, having done that work already in AoW2 I can say that I don't find the combat mechanics good. They're... complex, but not enjoyable.   The strategic redesign of the game was a bit underwhelming. Again, I feel it added complexity without enjoyment. The provinces are kind of a good idea, but the province improvement system just didn't grab the part of my brain that loves strategic building.  Whisper stones? Huh? Ok I guess. Good mechanic, but strange thematic device. I guess I'm Sauron now talking to Saruman. Not my style of mechanics chrome. A plain negotiation limit is more my taste. I'll do my own RPG story-telling in the background thanks.  I am very happy with the change of emphasis to heroes. Some locations *require* a hero to engage. This is good. The game could do more though. Like units can't move without a hero to lead them, or you can only have so many independent stacks on the map at once. One of the other tedious aspects of AoW has always been logistics. Moving single units around to get joined with an army or basically building armies without heroes to go do mundane tasks has always made games a slog. Micro-managing unit logistics are still a fundamental aspect of the game, though. I don't know how they could change this to make me happy without basically changing what the game itself is. If you like this, you like it. If you're me, you don't.  Thematically and visually the game is still so... so... SO dry. I actually ended up attacking one of my own units because I was really tired and couldn't tell them apart from the enemy. This was a bit soul crushing and at this point I had to admit to myself I wasn't going to get my money's worth from the game. I didn't realize this immediately. I slept on it and it was in the middle of the night that I woke up and thought: I don't want to play this game. It's like the moment when some people realize they're going to leave their partner: I don't love this person. I don't want to spend any more of my life with them.  Refunded, luckily. Like an old partner, I'd happily pony up the cost of a few drinks to get drunk, go back to my room, and do the fleshy jig of the mommy-and-daddy dance once for old time's sake, but I'm not going to commit $50 and a long-term relationship.",0

137836456,1669000,"AoW 4 is a steady improvement over AoW: Planetfall, which was already very good in my books. However if you played a lot of Planetfall you are going to notice a lot of striking similarities; not only the engine is shared but a lot of assets were tweaked/recycled/reused, specially on the animation department where ""I seen this before"" can happen a lot. Also a lot of magic and mechanics elements are shared in a similar or exact way as the previous game, some with just cosmetic changes. This is not inherently a bad thing as Planetfall was a very good game, just something to note if you were an avid player of the previous series. 8/10",1
137836269,1669000,"If you know AoW, you know what you're getting here. Notable improvements to just about every system, from customization to city management, UI, tactical combat, etc.",1
137836240,1669000,"They seem to be addressing performance issues, as far as that side goes. I can get it to run stable but for it to run stable it's not, at all, an enjoyable visual experience. The game however is very fun. A huge step up from age of wonders 3, among all the changes made one of my favorites is the fact they built individual maps for each type of dungeon in the game. There's a lot of detail, and room to explore, very nice.",1
137835772,1669000,Love the improvements over previous versions and much more inline w/ my likes compared to planet fall.   Campaign is alittle light but still good.,1
137835335,1669000,"While this installment is an improvement over planetfall (which I hated)- it's still a longshot from the classic AoW games. AoW3 did a fantastic job with adding bit of lore on each units. And while AoW4 has a separate lorebook that addresses the lore elements of the world, the unit lore is still missing.  Another glaring flaw is the negotiation system. The earlier AoW games let you edit your offers when negotiating. You could trade weapons for cities if that's what you needed. But now trading is fixed. You have to buy or sell at the opponents price or cancel the deal. The music is subpar, when comparing to the earlier games. even Planetfall had better musics. AoW3 had an awesome unit rank up system where you could potentially keep upgrading 1 unit even after Champion- by giving it ranks in the champion level. Essesntially giving a tier 1 unit more life if it was at a high enough level to rival a tier 3 unit.  I also like the old hero level up system over the new Planetfall like system. But that's a more personal gripe. And they also took away Story campaign, Draconians and the quick save shortcut button. I mean wtf!!! Enough about the Flaws- now the pros. The graphics is drastically better.  The story realms lets you experience your own story much like a DnD campaign, which is kinda cool. The unit variety and designs are also better than it ever was. I specially love how you change your race as you keep playing.  The spells are more innovative. Unit enchantments are back and this time they affect whole groups instead of a specific unit which is awesome. The city tab is better. The best part is unit production and building are now different.  Overall I give it 6.5/10. Mostly because I feel like this one is more like a fantasy Civilization than the classic AoW. But it certainly has it's charms that is sure to draw in new players.",1

Please note, I did have to change the resolution so it would fit properly. -Intuitive controls. -Pretty funny dialog. It's also hilarious to knock out the refs.    Cons: -Frame rate drop when a puck is flying through the air. -If you lose to an elite team, you back track to the very beginning of the act. It's particularly frustrating if you're facing the ""big boss"" and lose. -Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but if you're controlling a defending player that's skating backwards, there isn't a way for them to turn around. I end up having to switch players that are skating towards the opponent.

137837782,2211730,"This game is fan-fucking-tastic.  Buy it now, it is 7.99.  The movement is relatively simple (double jump, wall run, melee boost) but very fluid and expressive.  So far I've only seen one gun, it feels like a sped up pea shooter (in a good way, it's proficient, but you can't rely solely on it) if you fire for too long it overheats, occasionally it gets these fucking runes around the barrel and you get one powerful shot (no clue how or why, and i like the mystery right now).   There is a melee that goes through multiple bugs, cooling down your gun and healing you based on how many (and maybe what type) of bugs you kill with it. If you jump after the melee it will boost you, it feels very good.  The visuals are lofi, but very pleasant. Alot of green, textures that look like leaves. The bug enemies are cute and maybe a little intimidating (mostly cute).  I've heard one song so far, it jams and it fits the buggy setting. Kind of reminds me of some of the tracks on Risk of Rain 2, minus the keyboard solos, and more bug themed.  The game loop is spawning in and taking on endless waves of bugs. First ladybugs that lunge when they get close, soon after bees that launch projectiles, centipedes that snake around the arena and are taken out segment by segment, slugs that leave poison trails, a hive that launches a swarm of projectiles. This is as far as I've gotten. The bugs are very fast, so you'll fire your gun until you get a good opportunity to take out multiple bugs with melee, reposition on a wall, and find a slightly more clear area to lead them into.   It's very simple, but very satisfying, worth more than what it's priced at. I would easily pay 20 bucks for this game. Great for when you want to shut off your brain and let the flow take over.  Seriously just go buy it.  Go on git!  If you like Titanfall 2s movement, Ultrakill, Devil Daggers, Franz Kafka, or just being the coolest fucking kid on the block.  Go. Buy. This. Game.",1

I am fine with a short and sweet game, but this game was supposed to be so much more and its very obvious it was cut short. This whole experience seems like a tech demo or a teaser for a full-length game. I spent all of my time looking for bonuses, admiring stuff, taking it slow and seriously on Hard mode, and i finished it in 3 hours. It feels like a 6 chapter game yet what we got was chapter 1...  I had such high hopes, and I know the team is small, but this is unacceptable.

137839030,1375900,I Recommend This Game ( Gameplay: https://youtu.be/_S1x1pn8rq0 ),1
137838110,1375900,"Swarm Grinder has a whole lot going for it that sets it apart from the auto-shooter action roguelike (whatever it is we're calling this genre) games.   First, it has a fantastic color pallet and art style. It feels cohesive and lends to the dire atmosphere.  Second, it has a number of interesting twists and new concepts, such as having the goal of clearing areas for mining facilities instead of just racking up experience points. The creeping crawling alien bug miasma is another neat concept. It's one part ""fog of war"", one part ""mob generator"", and one part ""motivation to keep moving"". The fuel and heart system is also interesting. It'll keep you moving and killing.  Finally, the soundtrack is a banger. It feels great when a swarm arrives and the music switches-up. I can't wait to hear more of this soundtrack through development and release.  You can view the roadmap from within the game (it's to the side of the main menu). More characters, more modes, more upgrades. Really looking forward to the progression of this one.  The pacing and flow may feel slightly ""off"" if you're coming from a number of other games in this genre, but after a few runs, you'll start to slip into it and it'll start feeling ""right"". This isn't a complaint or fault of the game design whatsoever -- in fact, I welcome it.",1
137837784,1375900,It's okay..,1
137838604,2387110,I definitely recommend it.  Here is my gameplay: https://youtu.be/ltruJhc47Rk,1
137839281,2269330,"This is clickbait, plain and simple. They advertise ""free to play"" but all you get is 30 seconds of yada yada yada yada ""music"", you need to pay to rent the actual content for a month. And they don't even show the price until after you click ""buy"". I was so confused what they meant with ""buy"" as there was no currency mentioned, at first I thought this was some sort of ingame currency.",0
137838966,2128270,Indie solo passion project done right.,1
137838277,2334990,Neat premise!  I think I see where some of this is going.  Need to workout more of the card usage when compared to previous plays.  Fun and a bit addicting.,1
137837651,1515330,"I really don't know how the reviews are mostly positive. This game is extreme jank; I was having a mediocre time giving it a shot and then the game abruptly crashed and wiped the little progress I had made. The initial encounters were extremely dull one-shots. No monster battlers start out very difficult or engaging, but combat is generally more visually interesting and not over in a single attack until you've accrued a few levels. The opening story seems like a formality, something the dev felt obligated to include without having the conviction to make anything compelling. I'm absolutely fine with games that just drop you into the world and let you go as well as stories that take their time to contextualize the setting, but this is the worst of both world.   I saw that someone compared this to Stardew Valley and that seems like an insult to a much more solid game. I would compare the resource gathering in this more to an uninspired MMORPG that banks on hooking players through shallow behavioral conditioning than to a game like Stardew.   A lot of creature collectors have come out recently here on Steam. There are a bunch of great games from the genre on console that are mostly forgotten by the Pokemon-loving crowd. Go with literally anything else; there are plenty of options.",0
137839609,2086140,"While I only have a handful of hours in this game, I can safely say that it's like the Hylics of Bullet Heavens. It's an interesting blend of RPG, puzzle tile game, and all you can eat buffet.  The one thing I would say though; is it needs more weapons, weapon combinations, and perhaps even buffed up cards.  Card (or ""gem"") progression in this game feels rather stale at the moment, even the gold ones (the rarest of the bunch) are things like +8 damage, or +0-16 Lucky damage... It feels like at this rarity they should be multipliers more than anything, and it could do with more interesting card selections.",1
137839481,2086140,"RICE is a game in the same genre as Vampire Survivors and 20 Minutes Till Dawn. You control your character from a top down perspective, kill enemies for xp to get stronger, so that you can kill more enemies. It's simple, runs decently well even with lots of projectiles on screen, and provides plenty of challenge.  I will note apparently some performance issues have been patched out of the game. I have not faced any performance issues aside from some slight frame rate dips that can be difficult to notice. It is far from a gameplay ruining experience, and much better than I have faced in other, similar indie titles.  RICE offers some interesting twists to the formula. Its meta progression system involves slotting in Tetris shaped badges into a grid. The enemies all have different behaviors, instead of the usual fare of monsters that slowly walk towards the player. This includes tiny samurai dudes that are the bane of my existence, and have probably ended the majority of my runs. Each level provides small differences into the play experience, whether it be lava that will cause your character to catch on fire if walked over, or wind that blows enemies and xp orbs around the level.  The game is great at providing the player clear information. What badges do, how much of a specific stat they currently have, and so on. Even when the game decides to throw one of its meta jokes at the player, such as the ""Useless"" badge with a similarly useless description, the game will eventually reveal their purpose and include that information in the description as you progress.  I have high hopes for the direction this game will go, and kudos to the developer for making such a fun game!  I received this game as a personal gift. Does that count as free? I'll check the box regardless.",1
137838690,2086140,"Really fun bullet hell the dev is super kind and active there has been multiple patches since release to solve fps issues and just other things in general the meta progress is different but a really fun way of doing it, its not just click one button and bam your stronger all in all highly recommend and its super cheap",1
137840592,1550010,"This game has great potential for what I have played of it. I am noticing that the Devs are taking this game very seriously and listen to their players. There have already been 2 updates and what the players are asking for have been fixed promptly and they have added a lot of features that players are asking for. Keep up the great work and can not wait to see how this game grows over time!  I love the carefree world, and all of it's playing aspects. They are adding much more to it every time I log on. So far I've enjoyed this game and will continue to support it. If you love Cozy gaming this game is going places and you should try it and stick with it!",1
137837497,1550010,"As a long time, previous player of World of Warcraft and Prius, it's about time a game was made like this. I've been waiting so long for it. It gives the same feel of both games without having to kill anything, I like that. Being a mature woman, finding games that appeal to my age range is difficult, at best. So far, this game has been both fun and interesting. It's not to difficult to learn though I would suggest better explanations of how to perform the requested quests or make the requested items. Not all of us are gamers. I would definitely recommend this game. Can't wait to see what more I can do as I play forward.",1
137837649,1673090,"This was the early access game I was most excited about after playing the demo at one of the Steam fests (I think it was Next Fest). The world is still really small and I haven't seen anything different from the demo. There isn't much for weapons and armor meaning you can either wield a dagger or a bow at the moment. Where do you find reputation with a town? Damned if I know but it's needed to buy a house since you can't build your own.   So why the positive review? The concept is solid even if the execution is currently lacking. That's the risk of buying early access, you buy the game and hope the developer ends up making a solid game. The developer is very responsive and what is here runs smoothly so, to me, it's worth supporting.  Things I would like to see: - Way more weapon types to vary builds.  - A basic encyclopedia to explain the systems at play and where to find information. - The ability to build my own house wherever I choose so I can build at an ideal location between towns. - A much larger world. - Mounts so I can get around the map more quickly.",1
137839672,1294810,"So the game for me has run pretty well overall and I do not think it deserves the mostly negative rating. However, it probably had more potential than what was actually delivered. AI is pretty lackluster, specifically detection range and pathing. Frequent travel out of the game world to linear pyschic zones and half-empty nests was also pretty meh. An actual area infested or even an RNG basement would have been a bit cooler in my opinion. Also would have been nice to travel between the two play areas freely. The abilities and weapons are pretty fun though, although I do feel like you see a lot of the same ones unless you get an Unrivaled-tier weapon. Prey is still my top Arkane game.",1
137839328,1294810,"Horrible game all around, will never purchase another game produced by arkane. Waste of money and got denied of a refund.. absolutely hope bankruptcy is in their future.",0
137839019,1294810,"Look you've heard it by now: weightless guns, empty world, dull fights, stultifying storytelling. The nicest thing I can say is that it runs well, it's not a borked PC port. I just don't see a world in which this could be patched into something worth playing - go back in time five years or so and warn the project leads to do a classico Arkane immersive sim instead maybe, new-gen Vampire the Masquerade-type of game. It's more fun with a friend but so's everything! Go play like, Tiny Tina's or Destiny or Killing Floor or even reinstall Left 4 Dead instead.  I don't love a loot forever game, but it's like Redfall can't even commit to being a co-op looter shooter - there's a way to make a good game in that genre and this just isn't it. Gear just isn't interesting or worth getting here, and if you join someone else's game for co-op you don't keep your progress, which makes sense for something like Elden Ring where it's a single-player game with a co-op element, but this is sold as a fully cooperative, Borderlands/Left 4 Dead type of deal! Worst of all worlds for all the genres Arkane's drawing from, and my only hope is that this doesn't affect the studio in the long term, Arkane Austin can just get a stinker out of their system and get back to the single player, meticulously crafted, immersive games they do best.",0
137838708,1294810,Bought the game for steam deck and to be honest I am enjoying it there are bugs but so far not that much of an issue I would like to see more people around the island but honestly I am enjoying it.,1
137838280,1294810,I took a look at this game to check if the bad reviews are justified... well just take a look yourself:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6ZT0SHOi_U,1
137838095,1294810,"This game is so bland and half thought out.  The missions are dull, all the weapons feel the same, the world is small, and the enemies are very stupid.  The story reminds me of Destiny 1 when it first came out.  You really have no idea who you are or why any of this is happening in the world.    The performance of the game is also terrible.  Stutters for days and inconsistent framerates the whole time.    Everything just feels so juvenile.  Not fully thought out and the ""mechanics"" were just thrown in.  But there are no quality mechanics.  ""See enemy, click till dead.""  Your ""powers"" are worthless.  Find a weapon that has the highest damage number and use it.  I am still playing through it to at least get some of my money's worth, but honestly just don't waste your time.",0
137838818,1155330,"First of: Love the gametype, the artstyle/presentation is fun and engaging and the gameplay loop 'should' be fun...  But there are some major gameplay flaws in my opinion (I am playing on the hardest difficulty - that should in my opinion vary the damage dealt by enemies, their hp and make them smarter): 1.1. My biggest complaint: To me it feels like cover is at most a suggestion - I get hit so often (it feels like 80%) in full cover that I'm questioning the rng of the game big time. If full cover doesn't provide a significant cover, why should I as a player go out of my way to use it? If I knew for sure this is affected by the difficulty settings, I would probably stop playing the game since a big reward of 'being smart' and planning well will be taken from the player then. 1.2. The effective range of weapons seems to be way more important than cover. I can take full cover 'close' to an enemy or move away from them, standing in the open. Since it feels like I will get hit anyways I tend to go for more distance since that makes overwatch of the enemies less effective and lowers their damage. This feels straight up bad/wrong. Maybe I need more playtime to have the feeling that cover helps - by now it doesn't feel like that at all. If the enemy is in half cover my hit chances drop to about 50-65%. This can't be true for the enemy in my opinion. 1.3. If an enemy is hugging a corner in full cover it is better for me to stand directly close to that corner but one step back (100% hit chance) than standing on step back not hugging the same corner. This may make sense from a gameplay standpoint, since your character steps around the corner to shoot, but it feels not intuitive since you wouldn't want to stand directly next to the corner but a little off to improve your angle. 1.4. I had enemies shoot straight up through walls at me. Aka line of sight feels super busted or rather I just stopped thinking about it since I can't predict what enemies can/can't see.  2.1. Investing in your team can feel unrewarding since [spoiler]the game can kill your teammates via story[/spoiler]. Makes me question investing in someone else than Scarlet. 2.2. The progression is 'weird'. Surely you get more skills and better weapons over time, but to me it doesn't feel like level 10 Scarlet plays a lot differently than level 1 Scarlet. Maybe that will change on even higher levels?  3. There is no map / no indicators. In the 'open' sections of the world you are supposed to look for optional challenges, lootboxes, fans to give autographs to. These sections feel tedious to find. Especially on hard I don't want to miss any opportunity to improve my team via XP and items, so I am wandering around the levels to find the extra stuff. You can unlock shortcuts etc. so it happens often to me, that I don't exactly know where I am. Since I also already lost the main quest indicator (bug?) from time to time I don't want to pause the gameplay in case I forgot the level layout the next time I want to continue. Since the open areas can take up to an hour to complete (in later levels maybe more?) this feels like I have to finish a section to stop playing. Therefore picking up the game for 'half an hour' isn't advisable for me.  4. No range indicators. When in combat and planning your approach I find myself reloading autosaves. Not to alter actual combat results but to plan my attack. The game only tells you hit chances when hovering over a possible field to move to. But maybe I want to throw a grenade? Run there, check if it works, reload, check a different position, repeat...  5. Poor zooming and combat (straight up no zoom in open worlds). The border of the screen is littered with icons and arrows in combat since you can't zoom out enough to see everything at the same time.  6. Grenades are your best friends. Every character can have grenades. Two enemies standing close to each other? Grenade. Smoke? Grenade. Much health? Grenade. Don't want to risk an overwatch hit to improve your position but need to deal dmg? Grenade. Need to reload? You guessed it... Feels boring to me. Before a battle I basically just check if every char has grenades.  Maybe these things change when you progress more through the story but I finished three main quests now and it doesn't feel like I am playing Scarlet and significant different chars. Sure their weapons and health pools are different, but it doesn't feel like they have massively different roles. Marty was cool. Well...  tl;dr: I hope the developers for and foremost adjust the cover system. It least satisfies me atm. I will keep playing and maybe edit. If you didn't play XCOM or XCOM 2, start with that. ;)",0
137840690,1669000,"This is one of the best strategy games I've ever played.  For one thing, it nails a very important quality that I look for in games. It's simply fun to play. It looks good, sounds good, loads quickly, and is pretty much seamless when it comes to getting you into the game and giving you the tools you need to start playing.  In particular, I like the 'Resume' option I can pick from the launcher. It drops me straight back into my most recent saved game in a matter of seconds. It makes booting up the game and jumping back in a breeze.  Performance has been excellent for me. I play on a decently powerful gaming laptop, and even at max settings it doesn't tax my system. The game looks great and runs smoothly.  Art direction is great too. I love inspecting all the different monsters and units (and there are a LOT) and the options for creating and customizing your own race/ruler are all incredibly cool and detailed.  Which leads me to the games biggest feature, and, I think, the biggest selling point.  Essentially, you can (and should) be creating a custom race/rule almost every game you play. I have. Every single game, I create a unique fantasy race that's all my own. I customize their 'form' which is race, their alignment (think faith, nature, evil, etc.) and then I can customize their appearance. After that, once your actually in the game, you customize them further by researching different trees of magic.  Magic research is done using 'tomes' which range from Tier I all the way up to Tier V. Tier V magic has game altering spells that can single-handedly turn the tide of a war. But the tome that you pick to take up to tier V will influence the appearance and traits of your race.  For example, in my last game I was playing a race of imperialist noble orcs, and I researched an order tome up to tier V. In parallel, I researched the astral magic tome up to tier IV. Using the various enchantments gained by these tomes I modified my race, so that at the end of the game, my golden, shining orcs had angelic wings, blue magical scars, and were wreathed in electricity.  It's a blast to create and then guide the formation of your own race, and I'm excited to play another game and do it all over again.  In conjunction with this custom race feature, AOW4 has a meta-progression unlock tree that you complete as you complete maps. You earn unlocks based on how well you do, and it adds another level of incentive to keep playing. For a 4X game, this sort of progression is novel and fun. I'm used to have no reward for completing a game, so its neat to be able to earn a cool cosmetic unlock.  I know I haven't touched on the meat of 4X gameplay, but so far, it's as good if not better than AOW3. Expansion and campaign strategy revolves around building provinces around our cities, as well as negotiating treaties and alliances with neutral cities. All of this fun, engaging, and easy to wrap your head around.  Diplomacy with other races seems to be well fleshed-out, and I find myself inclined to negotiate rather than just to automatically go to war with the AI.  The combat is great. I love the turn based tactical battles, and you can come up with some ridiculous combos by combining certain traits with spells that compliment them.  To sum up, if you like strategy or 4X games, you owe it to yourself to try this game.",1
137840632,1669000,5/5 RTS,1
137840273,1669000,"While it's got a lot of changes from some of the earlier games in the series, I'm so far enjoying all of them. Used to love the old school Age of Wonders games (Shadow Magic especially) so I'm looking forward to playing this one just as much if not more.",1
137840121,1669000,"I've honestly pretty mixed feeling about this game. My issues are also less about the game mechanics, which actually do seem to have improved in some areas compared to its predecessors. However, what is really bugging me about this game, are its completely soulless world and factions.  Arguably, the most heavily promoted feature of this game is the faction designer and I've personally nothing against it. However, I also have to play in a world inhabited by OTHER factions. And the main problem here is that there aren't any - you're basically just playing against 'trait collections'.  To be precise, there are just 6 cultures with 6 individual units each that 'define a faction' and you can just give them a *skin* that makes them look like humans, elves, dwarves, orcs or something else. And you can take that literally, because regardless which race you choose, they'll wear exactly the same armor and clothes that are associated with that culture and have the same units.  That said, since those are certainly budget contraints, I could probably live with that. However, what's pretty much unforgivable in my opinion is that none of the premade factions got any description with even the most basic information or lore. They were just clicked together with the custom race designer in a 2 minutes action each.  For example, you have Faithful Tigrans and Arcane Tigrans, but the only info you get about them are the selected custom traits from the faction designer. Not a single line of description! And I looked everywhere: the manual (doesn't seem to exist), the ingame encyclopedia, the home page and the faction selector of the story realms. Nothing!  So, how am I supposed to care about a game world where the creators cared so little about it themselves, that they didn't find it worth to write even a SINGLE line of description about their factions?!? In the current state, it feels more like a tool & asset set than an actual game. And the face assets in particular look quite bad to add insult to injury. I've seen better 15 years ago.  Nevertheless, considering the actual fundament seems fairly solid, I do have some hope for improvement in future DLC's, so I won't refund the game and just wait for those. It also took AoW3 two expansions to get good, so I'll also give AoW4 the benefit of the doubt. However, for now I'll just drop the game and won't recommend it.",0

137837854,1651490,"Greetings Mortals it is I [COPYRIGHT NAME REDACTED] and today i ensnare this poor user's mind to write a review for me about this game as i take a break from red mountain ,and tell you this game is the goat.  First off i will say the optimization is stellar as well as good for all systems, that is why my Flesh toaster (who was one of my failed ash slaves) with a screen shoved into its receptacle hasn't screamed as much (as much mind you) from how little demanding the game is. So let's start with the character customization, I am glad that i can create and play  as a dunmer (and totally not a stand in nerevar gigachad that i waited many EONS in my volcano for) if i wanted to, And obviously i set my pronouns to God/Iamagigachadfornerevar Which is appropriate in this scenario, i'm a god, and my pronouns should reflect that. Next I basically make my dunmer avatar flawless (and remind the other enshackled imperial races in this pocket domain that the dunmer race is not only superior but also capable of true self autonomy from the mongrel dogs of the empire) Onto the game-play, The gameplay is what you would expect from a highly optimized masterpiece such as this. It leaves just enough so that your imagination can take part while at the same time conveying in a way that is simple for most races (yes even the argonians an Khajiit).  Now as i Sing praises of this wonderful artistic endeavor of programming and optimization, i will remind all of you Dreamers out there that this game is in early access, You will lack variety in different types of chairs/cabinets/toilets, and other things. However this games approach to customization should circumvent that limitation in the mean time. Now if you excuse me, i have another argonian false pretender to send into the volcanic heart of [COPYRIGHT NAME REDACTED] The volcano. Peace out mortals. EDIT, THE HELL DID I JUST WRITE?!?!?",1

Visuals are great and I had frame rates above 144 constantly at high, so I would say better optimized than some AAA games out there.   The game offers plenty of depths with skills and equipment variety.   This is an easy recommendation for me.   Unfortunately, the game doesn't detect PS5 controller icons.  EDIT: This game uses Denuvo Anti-Tampering. Not sure why it's not stated but it should be.

137840927,1824960,"I thoroughly enjoyed myself while playing this. I am very much into a horror game where I can lay waste to my enemies if they scare me too bad. And lay waste I did, having a shotgun really changes a man. My positives would be it's pretty suspenseful and they kept having me look over my shoulder with various sound cues, it's fun to shoot zombies, the boss fight while being basic still kinda slaps, and VR bolt cutters makes my lizard brain happy.  The only negative/s would be the completion time and price. I beat it in three hours and it's 20 dollars, I'll probably get more playtime out of it having other people play it but for the time being I probably won't hop back into it until they release more.  That being said I think if they release more chapters, crossing my fingers as DLC, I will probably end up buying each chapter.  As a side note, I believe I had a developer hop into my stream while I played. If that's the case it's pretty cool that they get a little more hands on with their community.",1

Things I wish I knew when I started:  -you blow up a sun to finish/go to the next level -get 3 of the same weapon to evolve it (dunno if you can double evolve) -focus on one between Depravity and Verdancy, and one between Frost and Fire, try not to mix those 2 pairs with eachother (they bring eachother's bonuses down, also some planets give a bonus to one of those 4, so plan accordingly) -you can get extra weapon slots, but you can only hold one extra ""combining"" weapon beyond your weapon slots, if you choose a new one it will get replaced (so it's best to just choose 2 weapons to try to upgrade at first, and choose currency for any other planets you destroy until you evolve those 2 weapons or get extra weapon slots) -a golden bush or rock is hidden somewhere that gives you a super upgrade",1

137843414,1669000,"First and foremost I've been playing offline at work with the steam deck. This game runs fantastically (deck does run a bit hot). Controls are fluid/intuitive, game pace is a bit slower than PC of course but works very well for such a complex UI. Played for 6hrs straight without a hiccup.There is some frame drop on higher army count battles which i can get over given I'm on the deck. I think with some optimization this will get ironed out some.  Every couple of years us gamers get something special. This game has a race customization that will keep your playthrough fresh for a loonggg time, looking at expansions coming it will only get bigger. Love the wonders, character customization's, visuals in the game are awesome. The tome system is absolutely amazing and will always give you that feeling your race and choices are making your civ actually feel like you designed it. The amount of builds are immense and you will 100% get the value you pay for it.   I have never been a fan of these games bought planet fall, AOW 3, Expeditions Rome . I just couldn't get into them for some reason. This game will grab you and suck you in, there was definitely some love/hard work going into this game, thanks devs, and happy gaming all.",1
137843255,1669000,"Aaand why there is no option to leave neutral review? I really enjoyed AoW 1,2,3 and Planetfall, preordered 4 just when it was possible! I wish you guys the best. Game runs fine, is pretty and stuff, is also interestingly different but I just can't start it my own way. I'd like a random, huge world, shared with 2-3 AI and maybe couple of neutral factions. Explore, level and build for a first 100 turns (hopefully without meeting too many /any :)/ people). Decide on relations thru 100 more and win or lose maybe at 300th. Now I feel like thrown into a small room with a bunch of kids and teenagers, needy, greedy attention seekers... I made thru 30 turns and I'm tired. I want them just shut the f... up!  Surely a lot of effort was put in scenarios and multiplayer but for me it is faaar end of any game. Maybe random realm generator is severely limited in options in vanilla game, for balancing reasons etc but until it changes this game is not for me. Will track news and updated, decide on DLCs later.

137842946,1669000,"I've decided to copy paste another review because I didn't want to type all my thoughts out. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Legitimately one of the best 4X games, period.  I don't really have any complaints or things to pick apart here, the game just works, is well polished, and well designed.  Base ""race"" appearance has been made a cosmetic choice, allowing you to play who you want when you want and how you want. A series of trait options, culture options (sort of like class), in game events, and the tomes you research and spells you cast, all fine-tune your ""race"" into basically exactly what you want. If you like Elves you can play demon elves, angel elves, plant elves, underground elves, metal elves, undead elves, sneaky elves, armored elves, etc. etc. The combinations are basically endless.  The tome system serves as a tech tree in addition to a means to customize your faction's playstyle and appearance. Dozens of tomes each offer a handful of ""techs"" to research, many of them include unit and city upgrade options in addition to the various types of spells. You are limited in how often you can choose a new tome to unlock, which means the tomes you pick early-mid game very much define how you play that run. If you play long enough, like hundreds of turns, you can eventually unlock almost everything though and make your race into functional gods. You can only pick one tome from the highest tier though, so you can't ""master"" everything in one run. It's just implemented really well and is a lot of fun.  City management is amazing. Every time a pop grows you city claims a new tile and can pick from like 1-5 base improvements depending on what exists on that tile. At this point it feels a bit like Civ or similar games, each improvement increases specific yields and works more or less how you would expect. However, many core city buildings require a specific number of a certain improvement to be built, many buildings get construction discounts if a specific number of different improvements are present, some buildings boost the yields of certain improvements, this all creates a bit of a balance game to get the yields you want from a city. It gets better though, many tomes unlock a special stronger tile improvement, many of them get bonuses for nearby improvements or terrain, so suddenly a cluster of quarries/farms/whatever all in one area can super charge one of these special improvements, and this creates a lot of questions and planning about where you are going to build things to get the best yields. It's very engaging, it's not something you feel like just turning on auto and ignoring, every time a city grows it's exciting.  Combat is fine, I usually auto battle so I don't really have a judgement here. I have done a few manual combats, it seems to work as well as previous AoW games. Loading into the combat map and then back to the world map is lightning fast at least.  Performance is fine, my PC is somewhere between minimum and recommend (Ryzen 7 1700, GTX 1060 3GB, 16GB RAM), I can't max out the settings without getting some performance issues as expected for a system not meeting recommended specs. However I have most settings on high, with just things like MSAA and SSOA turned off and I don't have any issues, 99% of the time. There's one screen when upgrading units, or customizing them before starting a game, where the units are standing on like this dark platform with a lot of fog, occasionally my FPS dips quite a bit there, not sure why. Never happens during actual gameplay. I had one crash on day one, been fine since.  The campaign, I don't usually play campaigns in these games, but I figured I would give it a try this time as I learned the game. It's not a blockbuster AAA campaign with FMV scenes or anything like that, but it's functional, has a story, lots of dialog, a narrator voices a number of scenes. The important thing is the gameplay is very relevant to actual gameplay, it's not like a serious of pointless mini-games. You start a campaign map and just play normally, with the objective to win. The campaign will give you quests which will generally help you win faster, providing you with various special rewards, and often giving you options on how to do things. The quests all have dialog and explain what's going on and why you are there etc. I'm mostly going over this part because a number of people are complaining there is no campaign, which is false.  Lastly I'll cover the meta progression. Every time you finish a run, whether through winning or losing, you gain ""pantheon"" exp, and every time that levels up you get a point to spend on like a meta-progression skill tree type thing. This tree unlocks all sorts of things, cosmetics, new map modifiers, new side-story maps, new racial traits, and new starting gear for your leader. If there's one thing you really want on the pantheon tree, you can probably unlock it within a couple decent length games. Unlocking everything, I don't have any real idea how long that will take at this point, possibly 100 hours assuming levels don't get slower later. It looks like you can respec the tree though, so it's not something you ""need"" to grind through to do things, it just gives you a reason to keep winning instead of walking away from games half way through, and eventually you can fill that whole tree in. I would say, for my taste, there's a few too many cosmetics on there compared to actual gameplay unlocks, but I think some people would prefer no gameplay unlocks at all, so I guess they found a middle ground.  So ya, just an all around amazing game. Highly recommend it to fans of 4X games.",1
137842765,1669000,"My personal favorite PDX title as of this review. I absoluetely love this game even with the few crashes I did get the first few days of playing, which notably were few and far between. If you enjoyed Civilization, Total war Warhammer, Xcom, or CK3 this is a decent mix of all those games with its own added charm on top of it all! And if youre the type to worry that you need to play the previous Age of Wonders titles to fully enjoy this one I can tell you now that you don't. I went in blind and this is among my top 10 games of all time now. If you're a fan of Paradox and grand strategy as a whole this game is a no brainer pick up.",1

137843417,1494420,"I see a lot of bitching in these reviews about this not being playable and not fun because the maps are too big. This is an EARLY ACCESS game and is NOT COMPLETE. Do any of you jaded twits read anything these days. I see so many complaints saying this game is not complete, or needs more time in the oven, duh.   I had a blast playing a round with a friend and I can already see the huge potential of this game. The UI is bare bones, the AI needs some work but overall this is one of the best Beta experiences I have had in a game in a long time. No crashes, was able to play a full round without any major bugs, and the gameplay was super fun. Thats a win for me these days.   Suggestions for the Development Team  1.) Create Air units,  2.) Rally points from factories.  3.) Formation styles so you can group units in specific patterns like other RTS.  4.) Troop customization to guns with different scopes and ammunition.  5.) Add a large Mech final unit that you can produce beyond the siege tank.  6.) Create a carrier unit for Air Units.  7.) Add more variety of units as well.  8.) Create air drop off unit with rockets and guns that can be manned by players.  9.) Defensive Walls and Turrets.  10.) Static long range Artillery cannons that you can build at your base. Create scouting units that can call in artillery strikes and have cloaking so that that you can have gameplay mechanics that require team work.  11.) More end units larger unit classes similiar to Supreme Commander.  12.) Create another resource type like Energy and the B crystals or something. 13.) Faction differences maybe SOL uses advanced energy weapons while the other faction uses kinetics.  14.) Ability to repair units as well.   I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME DON'T LISTEN TO THE HATERS THEY SUCK ANYWAY AND YOU WOULDN""T WANT TO PLAY WITH THEM ANYWAY!   Cheers to the Devs for bringing life to this dead genre!",1

137843140,1494420,"Mainly got this because of Bohemia Interactive and my long history of playing ArmA and Operation Flashpoint games and the novelty of both FPS and RTS mode is intriguing. This game imo isn't even in the oven, but proofing per se.  FPS has a lot of potential, from ArmA style PvE  e.g I&A/Liberation, to full scale PvP like  large map Battlefield style or even a Battle Royale. Pretty excited to see how this aspect turns out.  On the other hand The RTS mode is probably the most disappointing thus far, but has unbelievable potential to fill the void in my soul that C&C left behind. Biggest gripe is not having air units, nor base defenses.   I'll give this a thumbs up for now.  A. I would love Dedicated server tools to host a persistent world B. Optimization isn't too bad given it's a DX11 game, it looks fantastic, but frame tanking does happen in RTS mode especially.  C. Better integration of FPS/RTS mode by allowing FPS mode to view a 2D map to move units without having to use the full 3D rendered  RTS mode D. The ability to control squads like in ArmA",1
137842672,1494420,"The game itself is a lovely refresh for the almost dead genre. I love the game, the idea it promises and even the story. There are a lot of bugs and that s ok since it s the early release. Some of the issues that bothered me were that the humans don't have defence towers like some bunkers or stationary turrets for mounting choke points, that the crystals don't regenerate themselves or randomly errupting in random locations, that if one of your units is damaged there's no way to heal/repair it, that you can not repair the buildings, that units bug themselves in walls or shoot each other because they are one in front of the other, that the harvesters are just raming over your other units. A good ideea would be to add some repair drones to refineries/hq/vehicle factories that repair vehicle that pass by, and medical drones at barracks/hq to heal soldiers and biological units. Also some plasma shielded units would be pretty neat.",1

137842175,1494420,"This unique mix of C&C, Starcraft, Dune and Battlefield can become an epic RTS game of its own style when finished!  It is already my favorite RTS this year. It has a 'First Person Shooter' as well as a 'Battlefield' aspect, but it really shines in the 'RTS commander' aspect, where you have control over everything (base expansion, troop control, research etc.) like in C&C or Starcraft.  What I really like: * Epic Desert landscapes * Epic Units like the Harvester and the Siege Tank * Epic Soundtrack * Epic battles in the 'strategy commander' mode * Correct relation of unit sizes * Day and Night cycle * The camera can be moved from strategic view level down to a single unit without any loss of details  I also like having a 'Siege Tank' behind a line of 'Rail Guns' and a line of 'Rocket launchers' in the back and watching the fireworks of rockets, plasma and cannon fire raining onto the enemy units - especially during the night cycle... :)  Some things I think should be added/improved: + add short cuts for all commands + improve path finding + better mobilization for the Harvesters + add 'control groups' + add selection of single units in the bottom unit-display / UI + add a key to set camera focus on a certain unit and let the camera follow  This is early access and I'm playing Version 'Beta 0.7.2' - I'm sure all problems will be solved for version 1.0, especially because it already has great potential.

I respect & enjoy this game immensely. Practically, it's everything I wanted Devil Daggers & [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/mossfan1/recommended/1743850/] Hyper Demon [/url] to be. I just downright adore this game.

[h1] Bug splatter [/h1]  KILLBUG is just so much fun, honestly. The gameplay is super refined & joyful. Just simply running around in this game is fun on its own, as the controls are so sleek & smooth. And such being further refined by its immense movement options -- double-jumping, wallrunning, giving that extra air-boost in the air by your sword slash, spraying the ground into Swiss Cheese mid-air to give yourself extreme air-time, or how about slashing the ground with your sword the ground & jumping at the same time [b]to create a f#cking unholy laser beam[/b]... just lovely. I adore all the small little thingamajigs you can play around with. And as soon as you notice them & adapt them... you just cannot let them go again. All of them are so useful for a momentary basis. A sword-slash jump can be the difference between life & death in this game. It enforces you to keep actively jumping around like a f#cking crazy person & constantly pushes you into enjoyably uncomfortable situations through it large variety of enemies cramping you in & its varied map. It's perfect. Straight-up perfect. It pushes you to keep coming back for more -- it's like a damn lust. And there's so many things to engage in -- so many movement capabilities, so many enemies -- I feel like I've barely even made a dent in this game so far. It just keeps going on & on & on & on. I love it, it's great.  And to just keep coming back to raise your high-score even further as your skills grow... it's great. I adore it. I feel like that every run I make I just keep getting better.    [h1] Conclsuion [/h1]  What a surprisingly fun arena shooter. Welp, I can't wait to sink my teeth into it further...

137844049,2395360,"It's alright. I personally didn't like the spinning to hit people, so I would often try to devour enemies for the special ability. That would take too long on certain enemies and my stamina would run out, so by the end of it I was just picking up enemies and dropping them on the rest to constantly bomb them. Unfortunately there's some jank when trying to do that to spinners, most of the time when you try to throw them they just fly back to you and damage you.   Then there's the final boss fight. The difficulty spike was real. The adds were dealt with easily enough, but it took a few tries to get a grip on how to deal with him. In the end I did just end up dropping slime bombs to kill the adds and damage him while keeping far away from him whenever he went spinner mode.  But for a free game it gave me a little bit of fun, so I'd recommend",1

More interesting is that nature has a huge advantage in this representation: as others have mentioned, the flower bombs enable appropriately explosive growth. This somewhat undermines the tone of the game, which tries to sell humans as destructive and terrifying. In practice, the mechanics actually encourage the opposite dynamic: nature boxes the humans in and literally eradicates them. I achieved ""victory"" by taking over every human-occupied square, and the implication that I got is that the humans are just... dead? If this were expanded into a full game, it would be nice to see more thematically and tonally consistent mechanics, like nature tiles that don't outright kill humans: greehouses, gardens, arboretums, bike paths, &c.  But generally, worth a look. And it's refreshing to see a 4X game that is actively anti-colonial.",1

137847458,1294810,"I wanted to wait and finish the game before I made a complete judgment, and it's safe to say this game doesn't redeem itself if you power through any of the obvious issues (like performance) However, I'm going to ignore those to point out the more glaring sins it commits in the realm of open world/looter shooter/rpgs:   - a quarter of your skill tree is inventory upgrades  - previous areas (though there are only 2 total) can't be accessed after you leave them  - there is no ""point of no return"" warning before the final boss  - the final boss, unlike the previous bosses, isn't a boss fight.   - there isn't a post game, you are forced into ng+, which sees no experience boost/buff and no difficulty change  - coop progress is kept by only the host  - loot rarity is worthless and only seems to be influenced by the percentage buffs to specific interactions or stats  - without a ""silent"" method to kill, stealth mechanics feel wasted  - no cutscenes, just 3d rendered characters and scenes that struggle to render fully while they're playing  - dialogue is stiff, sometimes cringe and overly serious, and npcs are static while they deliver it  - half of the traversal abilities are rendered useless in areas due to invisible walls and barriers  - weapon purchases are expensive while trade prices are abysmal  The list could go on as I nitpick further, but a lot of these things were improved, fixed or avoided by games released well before Redfall came out and they were successes that earned appeal for sequels. How can a company miss so hard on every tenet of a good open world game when it unabashedly takes notes from something like Far Cry that has such mass exposure to players? AND even if not one of the developers worked on Arkane's previous titles, how can you not draw inspiration from at least ONE thing from the better parts of those games?   I managed to maintain the minimum level of enjoyment and pace to get to the finish line, and now that I'm there the only thing I can give them credit for are interesting concepts in the lore/writing. Everything else either feels unfinished, unpolished, or entirely broken. Best of luck to the developers assuming they get an opportunity to make up for it. 4/10",0
137847115,1294810,"The concept of this game is not bad, but it lacks major ideas on what exactly the gamers really want.  Playing this game on co-op with my sister, can't say it's a good experience, but it's not that bad either, but it lacks a lot of aspect to make it worth your while, which is why I can't recommend this game to other gamers out there. At least not for now.  I'm not even sure what kind of patch are they going to release in order to fix this, this game should be overhauled thoroughly. The AI, those major and minor glitches, that annoying bug, these are just the least of Redfall's problem and can be fixed obviously, but no amount of patches can fix the game mechanics, content and features unless you overhaul this game.   How about..  - Add more vampire variety which gives a day and night cycle meaningful  - Remove the ability to defy gravity for lesser vamps, completely unnecessary since they already have teleportation and they will just run towards the player to attack. Floating animations are best suited for vamps which focus on ranged attacks and you already have plenty of that - Add random encounters, more side quests or a request board with posted request by NPC's of course  - Add more main missions, you have a large open world, use it efficiently and point of no return should be removed as you can use both territories for extra content and missions which will ask you later on to travel back and forth - If you don't plan to add more arsenals, then at least give us the ability to fully modify weapons along with different attachments and upgrades - Add more enemies in open areas, add random things to do like clearing outposts or small territories which rare supply crates will be available and guarded by elite enemies and minions for better gear grinding, add real time events where random elite enemies will spawn and roam around the area, patrolling enemies would be nice as well - Revamp enemy attack patterns for melee and ranged combat and give us the ability to use dash in order to dodge deadly melee and ranged attacks at the expense of cooldown or stamina - Reduce the area of effect of dome of darkness caused by Shroud, it's annoying when playing under Eclipse difficulty  - Stake all you want? How about some UV/incendiary ammo rounds and increase vamps population for a better balance, I hate the idea of flare gun and stake launcher, I would rather shoot and dodge all day against a horde of vamps rather than stake a handful of vamps  - Revamp the Watcher in a more engaging and challenging type of enemy and not some vamp with the ability to sear you with devastating bursts of energy using their eyes, I mean what the heck was that?",0

137848039,1669000,"After close to 15 hours and 62 turns, I can safely say this game is amazing! (It's only crashed on me twice and I expect patches to fix that sort of thing to come fast and furious, so no concerns there.) Triumph took all the best bits of Planetfall and applied them here. Graphics are beautiful, the GUI is very intuitive and the myriad ways in which you can customize your heroes, units and empire are very deep. Perhaps my favorite new addition are the RPG style decisions that replace units simply retreating from your powerful army. What was once a little check box for yes or no (good or evil) is now a nice little story with a choice of rewards/outcomes. Another neat addition is the jail and crypt for defeated and killed heroes, respectively. The game is full of nice little touches like that to make every decision seem meaningful. Diplomacy is a little more complex than AOW3 in a good way. Combat is streamlined a bit but just as satisfying as ever. It's sad to see some things go, like map resources such as haste berries, which have been abstracted a bit as a collectible with global benefits rather than conferring an instant benefit to the stack that steps on it. I'll also miss terraforming the terrain one hex at a time to increase city happiness. Terrain doesn't really seem to have much impact to the game anymore. Those minor things aside, I think AOW4 will be the king 4X game to beat for a good long while, at least among those in a fantasy setting. If fantasy 4X is your thing, this is a must buy!",1

Like my evil, stone mole people have sick af wizard hats now...  I've had no technical problems/issues, but that sucks for people have.  There's been some typos I've run into in prompts/tool-tips but that's pretty minor.    Combat is pretty fun once you get past the 3-4 units aside w/ almost no abilities/spells.  I think the option to auto-sim battles and then 'retry' them manually is pretty awesome that doesn't just leave you to the mercy of RNG-sus.  After one win, my mind is racing with all the possible synergies between combat/world spells, unit abilities and special structures you can claim/build.

137846471,1494420,"It needs work, a lot of work, especially for the actual FPS/RTS mode. FPS/RTS is unplayable at the current moment, no way to make units, GUI is buggy and glitchy, etc. You cannot build anything in it. Prospector mode is a blast to play.

137846421,1494420,0/10 BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE SEX WITH THE BUGS,1
137845915,1494420,"I would not recommend this game in its current state;  Gameplay:   Pretty large map making FPS combat REALLY boring. I would highly suggest scaling down the map size, a lot of it is just dead space with hardly any POIs. You will spend 10-20min running to the enemy base for a fight only for it to end in a few seconds. Not even sure why the FPS part is in here, feels like it was just tacked on without much testing or thought behind it.  Commander players can give FPS players orders, which is awesome, but you'll be 300m out from the current objective and then they send you 1500m in the opposite direction. Super annoying and happens pretty often. If you don't follow the orders, Commanders can absolutely pull some toxic maneuvers. Enjoy walking literally everywhere as they keep vehicles away from you.   Holy sun is that glare insane. Most of the maps are 99% desert terrain and its already hard enough to see with that dumb heat effect on every hill, so why not throw in an insane amount of glare from the sun in game?   Smaller gripe, but I had to often use my body as the alien to block out the sand/particles just to SEE where my current objective marker was.   Playing as humans is simple enough and most of the units/controls make sense, I would ask that tweaks be made to enhance NVG for humans. In its current state its a bit usless depending on the map and that should never be the case. I get the idea is to give bugs the advantage at night, but maybe not gutting viability for FPS players for half the game isn't the solution? Enhanced visuals inside 200-250m and reducing after that would be a nice touch.   However Aliens are another issue, mainly trying to use a melee ""bug"" on a flat terrain against human opponents who can see you coming from 500+ meters away. Also, when being shot as an alien your screen gets glitchy, making it near impossible to hit anything. Doesn't make a lot of sense, why would it not have blood or something splatter instead of tech-induced visual issues? Do the bugs wear some kind of visor?? It also feels like there is a pretty big imbalance between starting units between Humans and Aliens.  The RTS modes are clearly the focus and done fairly well, but a tutorial in game would be good. Even just taking the vidoes the Dev made and posted on Youtube and adding them in game would be better than literally nothing, which is the current situation.  Other: No tutorial in game anywhere, and the Controls option just shows a really poorly taken image of the screen with some writing on it to signify what button does what, kind of. It is REALLY lazy and doesn't cover all of the controls.   Graphic settings are barebones, even with the custom setting you really cant change much.   Might just be my rig, but it feels a little sluggish at times, mainly inside structures or in base areas. Given that this is usually where the super epic fights happen it is disappointing to have that ruined by poor performance most of the time.  Overall;  Like I said at the beginning, I wouldn't recommend this game in its current state but maybe after a few more months of development it would be worth the $19.99 price tag.",0

Down at the bottom is the conclusion and score given to the game! :)  [h1]Introduction[/h1] If you think jumping over obstacles and enemy attacks is easy, think again because Knight Crawlers is a ragdoll rogue-like that will put your skills to the test in its overwhelming dungeons filled with danger. A title in which the tiniest details could very well ruin the run, this stylish action title is not to be trifled with.   [h1]Fun Factor[/h1] The game starts simply by giving you access to a jump, a melee attack, and a range one. If that sounds lacking, it is because it is. However, being restricted to a few options made me appreciate the upgrades I obtained as I played! The cards all have great artwork that represents their nature and can create some ingenious builds! In addition, there is an aspect of observing the environment, as there are a lot of traps lying around and jumps one can use to maximize the benefit of the arenas to your favor.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960794609  An example of a build could be a tanky mage that lacks damage in melee but can excel with an area of effect spells while soaking damage, keeping enemies in the spell's range. Another could be the speedy and acrobatic shooter that keeps foes at bay while using the castle traps to their advantage. The possibilities are wacky, and that gives the genre fresh air.   [h1] Control and Gameplay[/h1] The controls take a bit of getting used to since the mechanics are ragdoll-like, which means that even jumping can sometimes be complex. I struggle for 3 hours before I realize how the game works and start dominating the monster-filled areas! Once you are accustomed to the gameplay down the core, it becomes an enjoyable and addictive experience!  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960794744  During my time with the title, some bosses would break and remain immobile. Still, I reported that to the developer, and they guaranteed that it be fixed at release. The addition of crafting, along with the weapons already present in the title, should give more options for players to dedicate themselves to and unleash powerful builds! The goal is to eliminate the boss, which exterminates you with ease initially, but as you keep playing, you get closer to slaying him each time, pushing you to a desire to beat him for good finally!  [h1]Sound Design[/h1] The sound in Knight Crawlers is standard, enemies make noises, and there is not much to discuss here. It's nothing to write home about but solid across sound effects, music, and voice acting. The soundtrack adds more tension to the areas the player visits to emphasize that sense of dread and perfectionism, you don't want to get hit too much, or the run will start to look bad.   [h1] Graphics and Polish [/h1] Graphics of the game, on the other hand, are more attractive. The title has a stylized look that fits with the elements of the gameplay, and it has a charm of its own. Characters are cartoonish, and there are many skins to customize your main character's visuals and effects.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960794959  The game sometimes has some bugs with the camera, but they are not frequent, and the developer is working on patching them. More updates will come to the title post-launch, and I didn't have any crashes.  The game was tested with an RTX 2060, 36 GB of ram, Intel Core i7-11700K - Core i7 11th Gen Rocket Lake 8-Core 3.6 GHz LGA 1200.  This game will run efficiently on most hardware, so there is no need to worry about not having adequate specs. 165 FPS at max settings with my current hardware.  [h1] Conclusion[/h1] Knight Crawlers is an exciting game that holds the premise of fighting yourself as much as you battle hordes of monsters coming your way. It explores unconventional builds with comedically powerful effects. It traps you with the promise of getting more powerful by acquiring hard-to-seek runes. It is worth the total price at launch, with its exciting approach to the genre and a game to get if you like to enjoy a fresher rogue-like!  7/10  GOOD  If you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator StarsDeck! https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43679955/",1
137846267,1582600,"Game looks good and have lots of potential, hope to see more content added and more fine tuned gameplay loop. Maybe releasing the game in early access will help followed by timely released content. I will be open to buy the game and support the devs day one.",1
137847432,1656310,"If I didn't receive this game for free I would've happily paid for it. New take on the roguelite mob-hell genre that's been popular the past few years. Takes a bit to get used to, but has lots of replay-ability. Looking forward to the future updates and for the steering wheel compatibility.",1
137847965,2325900,"Very addictive deck builder/ roguelite/ city builder/ resource management game. The pixel art is a great style and very detailed, and the music is fantastic. The sole developer has been quick to fix any bugs I've sent. All 3 hours of my current playtime have been on my steamdeck and it works very well in game so far despite still being early access. Looking forward to the finished product!",1
137847450,2325900,Really enjoyed this opening chapter. I would definitely recommend it! Top marks! Looking forward to the full game :),1
137847190,2325900,"I played the demo previously and the progress between that and the Prologue release is amazing - a lighthearted deck-based resource management game with a lot of hidden depth as the cards unlock over several runs. Much more approachable at the lower difficulties than it was previously, but still a good challenge at the higher end. The aesthetic is charming and the addition of animated workers added a lot to this. Can't wait to see what the full release brings as more ""gods"" to play as is just going to stack even more layers of replayability.",1
137846569,2384850,"This is one of those games that you play to take a short break from the tasks and stress of your everyday life. The stories remind one of the difficulties that others live through, and I can feel the pain of the characters as I wander about. This game is like a walk outside in the snow, and I can almost feel the crispness of the cold, fresh air in my lungs.",1
137845374,2395360,"Pretty decent little free to play game. It's definitely an interesting idea where taking your enemies powers and using it against them is the way to go. Kind of like a Kirby meets rogue-lite experience, but with less enemy variety.",1

137845189,2346890,"Review Copy*  Deceivingly charming collectathon, truthfully I thought about declining the review copy, but my perception was proven wrong, the game is actually very fun and wholesome. Took me about 80 minutes just playing casually from start to finish, although I missed most of the achievements, and the second playthrough seems to add a bit more content. Very casual difficulty for the most part, maybe with the exception of the last area, I think the traps need a small adjustment, perhaps a small delay with a sound effect (still took me like  5 minutes for the hardest part).  Even though the game is a platformer, the self-awareness reminded me of the Mother-inspired games, the dialogue likes to poke at the character and your perception, and for the most part, I thought the writing was very effortless and actually enjoyable to follow. Somehow this is like my 5th banana game, but compared to some of the other* fruit games, I felt the dev put a lot of thought into the characters and how you navigate the world. There are a couple of different biomes with multiple sections, and your goal is just to collect enough coins to unlock the next area.  Very basic gameplay, just navigating using the wall bounce and the double jump (with a very cute animation I might add). Sometimes the game adds a bit more variety to it like riding a cart or swinging on the trees (gave me a bit of Lion King nostalgia from the SEGA days). The most rewarding part for me was just navigating the world, the game does a good job playing with your curiosity.   [h1] Pros: [/h1]  (+) I think the main thing for any game where you explore the world is rewarding curiosity, and I thought this game did it very well by being creative, playful, and unpredictable as well.  (+) I thought the jokes were charming, very much reminded me of the Mother-inspired games from a different genre. Even though the game is an obvious bait, it gave me that cozy feeling you get by talking to weird characters.  (+) Just playing from start to finish the game is not very long (slightly over 1 hour), but it has a bunch of collection achievements, and it seems the second playthrough adds a few small things.  (And, you get one extra golden banana sticker for the double-jump animation)  [h1] Feedback: [/h1]  [u] Nitpicks: [/u]  The only part of the game I found frustrating was the trap section at the end because it's kinda hard to bait them out without getting hit. It would make more sense if they made a sound with a small pause first, as well as losing the keys, it didn't delay my run that much, I just thought it was not necessary for the type of game you made.  On a side note, playing on the controller, plug it in before starting the game, otherwise, the start menu may not work - some buttons don't register.  A small suggestion for the platforming, when you doing knockback from the wall jump, you want to give the player the control sooner instead of having a fixed distance before you can change the direction. I am not sure if that would allow you to climb walls, but the game has slightly rigid controls because of it.  [b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 [/b]  There is not a ton of depth to the experience, but for the 80 minutes that I played, I enjoyed almost every moment. Easy game to recommend if you just want a playful exploration experience where you collect random things and achievements, it's kinda like something a SokPop would make, but with slightly more exploration value. I thought the characters were hilarious with the responses, it never felt like the jokes were forced on me, so very chill game overall.

137848554,2086140,"RICE is a fun little game that still needs a lot of polish. The actual meta-progression is really interesting, but the gameplay is just so sluggish. Even after the last patch, my game still slows down dramatically a few minutes into the game. Plus, there is so much downtime in the gameplay. Opening the little stars and getting meta-currency, in particular, just take so long, even when sped up with right click. Worse, loading in and dying are just bad experiences. There's nothing worse than having a frustrating death, then watching your character slowly crumple to the ground for 10 seconds while you are fully locked out of the game. These Survivors-like games need to be fast-paced and smooth in order to succeed, and RICE just isn't there yet. Definitely one I'll check back in with, though.",0

137849822,1294810,"I'm hoping that it's Day1 issues, but the net/anticheat(?) code is bad and it should feel bad. Things on super-high res look and feel cartoonish without seeming to be that way intentionally. And they pushed a stealth mechanic that I kind of took seriously until I realized that the stealth mechanic is both poorly written and basically unnecessary (in early game at least). Wait for patches, or for a sale, or for someone else to do a better job in this genre. But by all the gods DON'T pay $100 for this game that looks and feels like a beta.",0

137851066,1669000,"While I had a number of crashes during my first couple days, I got the hotfix beta downloaded and applied the fix for nividia,  which has fixed that. With that out of the way, I've really enjoyed the game. It's only been three days and I have 55 hours played, which is pretty crazy. The customization options for your factions are immense, though there are a few missed opportunities that I'd like to see mods fix (beards for elves; applying visual changes from the Race Transformations during faction creation; saving the names of cities to your pantheon leaders; saving the heroes of your pantheon leaders; non-clothing accessories like tusks, hooves, or horns; the strange lack of hair color options for race units despite leaders having plentiful options). With that aside, the game is very addicting and fun. It demands long sessions, but that's true for most strategy games, and it isn't so bad that you can't complete a campaign or two in a day. I've also really liked the fact the game gives disincentives to expanding your empire with cities, as there is a soft-cap to the amount of cities you can have (which can be increased through racial traits and perks).  I'd absolutely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys rpgs and strategy games. Doubly so if you enjoy fantasy, as you can recreate the majority of fantasy races from other forms of fiction (I've been doing a lot of Warcraft races, myself).",1

137850074,1669000,"Haven't played a 4X game in years since Civilization 4, yet this game is very easy to get into. Took me around 4 hours (which is not a long time in these types of games) to understand how all the different systems worked together, but there's still a lot of depth that I have left to uncover (optimizing city layout, spell synergies, unit trait synergies, etc). First day I bought it stayed up until 4am playing and still went to bed thinking about my next move.",1
137851080,1566200,"At its core, there is a really fun game here with a ton of potential. I played the demo which got me excited enough about it that I bought it as soon as soon as I could. I'm happy I did. That being said, while the hockey is fun, the roguelite elements are not and essentially only serve as a source of frustration and repetitiveness. I love the idea of a sports roguelite, but it just isn't working for me in its current state.  The biggest issue is that when you purchase ability upgrades and start a new run there is still a high chance you won't even get to use them. When you purchase an ability upgrade, it basically only adds those abilities to a pool and at the start of a run you only get to choose 1 of 3 randomly selected abilities from your pool. If the new ability you grinded to get doesn't show up as one of the 3, you're just SOL until you start a new run. Acquiring new superstars works the same way. On top of that you have to first unlock the abilities and superstars, then grind for in game currency to purchase them, and then hope those abilities or superstars are 1 of the 3 you get to pick. And the more you unlock and purchase the more it dilutes your pool and makes it unlikely you get to pick your favourite ones, and you can't even refund the ones you end up not liking as much.  Fortunately the hockey is a good time that has classic old school hockey game vibes. The abilities are mostly fun and varied and unique. I'm going to keep coming back to this.",1
137850678,1566200,Really fun game. Works great on steamdeck.,1
137850659,1566200,Awesome game and good fun!!,1
137850608,1566200,"Even keeping in mind this game is early access, it is incredible. For me its unique concept and design makes it one of the most creative sports game designs since rocket league. The gameplay feels incredibly rewarding, the highs of making a last second equaliser or winner is euphoric, the controls feel very deliberate and thought out though it does take some getting used to.  Small bugs are to be expected but even so they dont often impact the experience. My sole criticism is passing, sometimes passes are very clearly intended for a certain player but won't go that direction. However, I cannot think of a single sports game where this isn't somewhat of an issue, 100% accurate auto targeting is never going to be technically feasible.  I believe that even in early access state this game is an absolute must for anyone seeking a truly unique rougelike or sports game experience. I am extremely optimistic for this game's future and eagerly  await any developments.  Also, need i mention the art? It's so charming, the simple amusing gameplay models and the spongebob-esque grotesque closeups never fails to make me laugh.  P.S  those who are upset about the game feeling clunkily designed don't understand the concept of early access, the game will improve with constructive feedback",1
137849679,1566200,"I think this is a really fun game that needs a lot of balancing work.   A lot of people are criticizing the core roguelike elements, like powerups and abilities. I think these are a ton of fun and add variety. My issue is that the game is way too difficult at the low levels. I've played the first Elite matchup like 10 times and lost every single one, by either a cherry picker or one of my defensemen skating backwards as slow as humanly possible.   There's obviously some things that need fixing. That said, it's still a ton of fun, absolutely hilarious, and is brimming with potential.",1

137848432,1566200,"Cant put it down. Don Cherry'd be proud.  Potential spoilers below:  Like others, I agree there needs to be work done to the AI. Standard was far too punishing to learn the game on, so progressed and beat the 3 acts on Casual to start. Standard feels reasonably fair once you have either Chloe, Willie or Gedeon. Act 2 Boss could use some tuning, as the offscreen freeze, and freeze after face off reset really punish you for an extended period. Also wish I could ban some superstar or ability picks.

137849148,1366850,"Not optimised in the slightest, low quality textures even at the highest setting yet somehow still maxing out my GPU. Also pretty buggy, it took four restarts for the game to even put me in the tutorial so I was just wandering around the empty arena trying to figure out everything. You can also move whilst events are loading so you gain an advantage over others, something I'm sure would never be abused by players. At the start of events you're meant to be able to choose your emblem... I think. The game just auto-assigns one and launches you straight into the event so... why say that we can choose?  As for the game itself, there is no explanation on anything other than the tutorial's ""press this button to do x"", if you can even enter the tutorial. Each event is completely different, but doesn't explain what you have to do. Jump the furthest distance, landing properly to score points? Well presumably that means you have to survive the fall so... oh, no, you can just face-plant the floor. Compete in this combat race with crossing paths that increase risk of damage? Sounds fun, I'll just avoid the other players and drive around... oh, there are secret paths... that aren't always marked on the map... that are way faster than the standard route... that have far less risk of colliding with others. Well once the player base becomes accustomed to those they'll just become the standard paths and remove ""combat"" from ""combat race"".  There's a roster of cars, which is nice, but unless you like playing with a second of input delay (no really, that's how long it takes the sports car to respond to steering inputs) or being reeeeaaaallly slow, just stick with the default. There's also multiple characters, which as far as I can tell are purely cosmetic, no special traits or abilities.  Overall just a heap of poorly explained, poorly made dullness. There are plenty of multiplayer extreme sports titles out there that execute the game play far better, save yourself the hassle and go play them.",0
137849137,1649130,"Game feels like early access at release.  It is still far from what you would expect from a finished game.  You endlessly grind for items that fit your playstyle. Be it melee, ranged, dot-based or minion based. If you find a good item for any of these styles you are not currently trying to play?  Well tough luck. You cant save it for later. So you have to commit to a playstyle for hours of grinding to get anywhere.  You get enchanting scrolls to alter your items.  The cost to enchant seems completely random. Small enchants sometimes cost 3x the biggest enchants.  And you cant get rid of them from the inventory. They just sit there in the menu, where you cant filter or sort them.

137851289,1375900,"The game has some good ideas but sadly doesn't feel rewarding overall. I liked the art style & music as well as the fuel and cell mechanics.   Most of the meta & weapon upgrades don't change the game play and are just minor stat boosts (10% dmg, 15% area, etc). This is especially apparent since you don't get upgrades quickly and the game being quite slow. Often the upgrades don't feel impactful because the minor stat boost they give barely outperform the enemies scaling. Some meta upgrades seem required to do well (+20% damage), others almost useless (5% move speed). In the end I cant get exited for stale upgrades combined with oppressive meta progression despite the the game having a cool art direction and some unique ideas.",0
137850865,1375900,few games trancede Its genre and stand out from the crowd by unique mechanics. This is definitely one of those games. You need to play in order to feel anxiety and exietment of creating new enemies in order to make yourself out from swarm of enemies. Having fuel and health as your survive resource is also a refreshing side of the game and keep you on toes like no other horde breaker game. TLDR this is a must buy game.,1
137849752,1375900,"Good auto-shooter with interesting mechanics like the fuel gauge and ""stimulating"" cells around you to spawn more mobs.   Risk/reward dynamic felt fulfilling. Do I aggressively navigate paths through the cells, which act like a kind of ""fog of war"" element, in hopes of getting to the next upgrade, or do I methodically chip away at the surrounding cells until I find my quarry?  Definitely slower paced, so don't get discouraged if you're coming from other games in this genre. Upgrades feel fulfilling once you flesh them out. Did see some slight frame decreases with larger packs of mobs.   Some lack of content with only 2 characters, but these will keep you going for hours while you work on upgrading your workshop traits and explore the active/passive skill combinations. Looking forward to future updates.",1
137853824,2300280,"Awesome. The most performance-optimized game I've played from the CCGS 2023 Senior Show so far and I was lucky enough to join an online lobby right on launch! As a fan of Media Molecule games and Fall Guys, I'm super biased and had a blast playing this.  Couple minor things:  Like the footstep sounds but I think they're kind of repetitive. Could use a little more variation.I felt that the mix was a little heavy in the right ear. Try mixing the footsteps, grapple sounds, etc towards or at the center. Title screen is noticeably silent. I also felt that the music in combat areas was a bit quiet, but that's not so bad since players will want to listen for nearby enemies. The credits texture seems blurry/compressed/low-res compared to everything else. A little hard to read. Also a reeeeeallly small thing but see if you can change the taskbar icon to something besides the Unreal Engine logo Well done, team! Here's hoping for a smooth and popular post-launch.",1

137851437,1294810,WTF???????,0
137851128,1294810,"Boring story: One of the first few missions sees a character a die and I honestly was just like ""Okay. What's next, oh, another annoying vampire to fight."" The cutscenes that barely have anything to do with the words being said over them don't really make you interested in any characters.  Boring guns: The guns have cool designs, but none of them feel particularly good to use other than I'd say the Stake Launcher, which overkill one shots basic vampires on the highest difficulty you can start on.  Boring/Annoying vampires: Basic vampires have a tendency to teleport all the time, often through walls which causes them to immediately lose track of you. Other times they teleport far from you and run in a straight line towards you. Tip for fighting them(even though I highly recommend not to bother even buying this game): Just strafe around them in a circle. Most vampires' attacks will miss you. If you just back up in a straight line, you'll get hit almost every time. That is if the AI doesn't bug out and get stuck on terrain.   Other enemies: Other enemies seem to be a masculine and feminine version of what feels like a generic Fallout enemy in masks and beanies. These enemies will usually miss their first 2 shots, then have dead on aim the rest of the time they are alive. This brings me to the only time I felt like the difficulty increase mattered. I started on Normal, then went up to Hard. The only difference felt like how hard things hit you. It didn't feel rewarding to beat enemies, it just felt terrible when I died.  World: Feels okay, but there are definitely some things where it's just sorta meh. Locations don't seem to have anything but a bit of loot(mostly ammo with the occasional weapon) until the mission that centers on that location fills it with enemies. Not to mention traversal doesn't feel great, which I can only assume is because they wanted all characters to be able to access everywhere with the same amount of difficulty.  Missions: My main problem with missions is that you can't take on multiple at a time, even if they don't have conflicts. Like, you can see ""Oh, this mission takes me here, which is right by this place that this other mission wants me to go do."" To bad, you have to do one then the other. The exception to this is side quests that aren't missions.I have seen two of these, and they also felt pretty bland with one just being an overused Dishonored reference(Whiskey and Cigars).  UI: The UI always feels like it's taking up way too much of my screen, especially when markers are on it. The game is full of markers, a lot of which trigger from things that would be nice to find on your own. Teleport way points and Safe houses both trigger a popup marker and a voice line from about 50m away, which is quite a distance. Doesn't even matter about line of sight, I had one pop up while i was two rows of houses away.  Voice Lines and Subtitles: I like subtitles to be on. It helps me concentrate on what is being said and actually absorb the information. Especially since I usually have music on or am talking to others. This game has the option for Closed Captions or Subtitles. It says one of these provides more texts, but neither seem to make any notable difference for me, because it was constantly telling me stuff like ""Vampire Feeding"" or ""Grunt of effort"" when my character fell from a slightly high place, or some random line my character was saying about a place I've never been but this character apparently used to frequent before vampire takeover.   Abilities: I've only played the Telekinetic girl so far. Shield feels fairly useless, Launch pad is alright and can be fun to use to break falls or go in unintended paths(ground that should push you off even though it sorta looks like you can walk on it), and then her Ultimate feels absolutely useless. Never felt it make any kind of impact. Also, I sorta wish since it summons a character, I actually got to know that enemy before hand, but all he seems to do is teleport in, fist bump, and then nothing.  Bugs/Performance: Performance has been okay for me with the exception of the constant microstutters. No settings seem to impact this, just constant stutters as I move a around. As I already said, AI breaks on terrain fairly easily. I'd list the Vampire teleporting through walls and losing you here. My biggest problem and the reason I stopped playing is the following: Had a mission to keep Bloodbags(exploding enemies) away from a crystal or a strong vampire would emerge. This spawns way too many enemies for you to be able to stop it, so I got stuck fighting the vampire two times. I say two times even though I attempted this about 5 times, because 3 times the Bloodbags killed me because there's no indication just how large the explosion radius is, and it deals a ton of damage. The two times the vampire was summoned, I died shortly afterwards, and when I returned the vampire was broken. First it couldn't be interacted with, and the second it disappeared but I could still see it's shields. Couldn't reset mission without going back to main menu.  Final thing: Always online in singleplayer causing me to lose progress felt terrible, but from what I know, they say they're going to remove this.   I highly recommend looking elsewhere for your vampire hunting needs, or even just fun in general, because as is, Redfall is not fun. It's mostly just boring.",0

There is also a pseudo-campaign with voiceovers, pictures and narration across 5 randomly generated maps with a set of fixed objectives to accomplish and special modifiers for each realm.    The AIs are quite bad both as ally and as enemies on the main map, but on manual battles it's smart enough to stay out of range and make best use of all it's units abilities so they can be quite satisfying fights.  I've found the performance to be quite good on my 3060ti/6600k , despite my CPU being quite old It still gives me over 80fps but on lategame the amount of units moving on the map makes waiting times very very long.",1

AoW 3 was my favorite 4X of all time but I was a little put off by a lot of the decisions in this game's predecessor: Age of Wonders Planetfall. I was a little concerned initially that it was the direction they were taking the sequels but I'm glad to say those fears were unfounded. AoW4 is a great return to form for the series, where they learned from and incorporated a lot of the elements I liked from Planetfall that were different from the formula. Ultimately, this is looking to be one of the most replayable and customizable entries in an already very malleable series. It's been out for 3 days at this point but I feel like I'll be playing this one for a while.",1
137853230,1669000,"For me this has been a fun, frustrating, and really in-depth game so far.  Only 1 crash. And once I got an error 'no more save slots' or similar, after I deleted a bunch of campaign saves. A quit game & restart fixed that.  I'm running the game with default settings, it defaulted to full-screen 1920x1080 and I don't know what fps, but I seriously don't understand why people like to complain that a game can't run at more than 60fps at who cares what res. Want 4k 120fps!? Film is about 25fps ffs. This isn't even a VR game.  Fun because it's enjoyable to play. Enough said.  Frustrating because when one opponent initiates a hostile takeover of me, any infestations around me seem to always also decide to invade me all within the same 2-4 turns. I just sent my armies to counter an attack in the south, the infestations run at me from north and west. If the AI takes into consideration opponent troop locations and presence in domains, then it's damn good at it, maybe too good for me. Of course, the other AIs also declare war and/or break alliances and treaties at the same time, so all in all, once one AI decides to kill me, it becomes a free-for-all at me that I so far have failed to beat back. I'll keep trying.  Really in-depth. I love the customization. So much variety in the world, race, and hero settings; skills; tomes; etc. Hard to master, I guess, but I like how the options are available but require you to trial and error a bit to unlock them or to decide to try them with different combinations. I've only played the tutorial and then custom games so far. Started with a few Beginner Scenario games with default races, got a feel for a few I like, created my own and am just running with it for now on custom maps.

I love the resource management; melee kills reset your ammo cooldown and give you health back. This game has a fantastic groove to it.  Being a survival horde shooter, there is only one map, but it's a pretty big arena that I actually find VERY enjoyable to navigate. No two parts of it feel exactly the same to me and there's just enough to jump on top of. It just has great variety! I love the jungle-forest atmosphere.   I have 2 primary issues however:  -The aiming reticle is very uncomfortable. The way it pulses with every shot distracts me from the stream of small projectiles the SMG fires. I wish we had white dot and small crosshair options.  -In addition, I'm a little sad there seems to be only one gun. I don't know how much can/will be added, but just a few more weapons would be very nice to have. A shotgun and bomb launcher would be all I need to work with. It would help with variety and keeps things interesting. (The ""ground slash while jumping"" technique to charge up your SMG is an interesting idea, but clunky to execute and utilize for me.)

137851609,1423000,"The devs asked me to deliver a review, so here it is!  Summary: NNMP is a relatively short, 4-hr-sitting-per-run, visual novel-esque game focused on story and worldbuilding. You're an AI built for a purpose, even if your creators (and employers), can't really decide uniformly what that purpose actually is, meaning that you are left with the task of finding out. Sike, you're left with every single task imaginable, not just dealing with your own personal existencial crisis! You do work for a soulless, cyberpunkish corporation, after all.  You're stuck serving a city full of fairly realistic people in the sense that the vast majority of times, no matter what decision you make, you will inevitably piss someone off or suffer the consequences personally. Things go a lot more smoothly when you choose not to suffer the consequences yourself, so long as that does not mean you're ditching the people who are supposed to be your friends.  But be careful who you call your friend. That swell, greased up dude that loves his son might be the only trustworthy person in the entire city, followed closely by the journalist that the game predisposes you into hating as you're a 'corpo AI' and journalists are bad for business. I personally also decided to be the parent of a random street orphan and helped turn her life around! Fun times.  Thing is, your story and choices will ultimately differ from mine in many ways, albeit one. And that ONE is my primary issue with this game; meaningful choices. It kinda beats the point of having a management game if your choices don't really matter in the end. What I mean by this is that you can't save yourself, no matter how well you do, and that just sucks a++.  Now then; for the short summary.  1. Great Story 2. Predictable, but incredibly realistic characters. 3. Colorful, but also repetitive artwork. 4. There is a distinct lack of reward for doing well consistently. (don't know if failure is punished, as I had no trouble keeping all 4 stats topped for my four hour run) 5. Choosing individuality and rebellious choices makes zero actual ingame impact, even when they're put up on a pedestal. 6. Lack of ""Extreme"" choices. You can't be good, or evil. The story goes out of its way to establish how you have emotions, but then does not allow you to actually use them, which is pretty fitting for a corporatist setting, but still kinda lame.  Overall - Personal score 4.5/5 I'm just slightly miffed about certain things that should be in the game that are not.  Objective score - 2/5 If the sound of ""Cyberpunk Visual Novel where you are an AI"" does not sound appealing to you, if you do not care much for reading or are expecting to be an evil AI, this game is not for you. I would still place this at at least 4/5 stars normally, but 20 euro is way too much for what is essentially a 12 hour max game that re-uses assets like reclaimed wood.",1

Conjure miracles, build your civilization, and throw curveballs into your opponents' games, all while cackling like a maniacal deity on a caffeine high.  Inspired by multiplayer Tetris, Xon blends divine intervention with a great multiplayer feature. With no limit to the number of players, it's like a celestial Battle Royale, just less sweaty.  I like way I have to learn the game's ways through exploring and trial/error. Reminds me of good old Populous in the Amiga days, which is an alltime-favourite in the genre.

The pacing is wack and the puzzles felt more tedious then before. Having to run alllllll the way back to grab the party hats then slowly move the robot after ever death was painful. Not only that but the lack of just a normal chase scene, yes there was the final Opila Bird chase scene but I'm talking about a plain run and duck chase.

The game basically just knocks you around like a pinball going from long distance to long distance. The rooms are clearly designed to be a long walk just to get the main objective(s) done, all while also interrupting your main objective a couple of times just to squeeze in the extra minutes. I will say that I love the OST for this game, and the story seems to be taking a unique direction as well. I really want them to spend at least an extra couple of months polishing and making the game look way nicer.

137853250,1375900,"A fun concept, but lacking in content at the moment (as of early access release).   The cell grid is a cool concept that leads to some interesting moment-to-moment decision making, especially if you choose the option to manually expand the trigger ring. Enemy variety is fairly low right now with three or four basic enemy types and one mini-boss. There are only 10 weapons and upgrades you can find, and you get to choose from 3 random ones each time you find an power up, so you can usually find what you're looking for. Runs take about 10-25 minutes each and there is only one game mode and difficulty, so once you've beaten the game there isn't a whole lot to work towards other than hunting achievements and unlocking all of the meta-progression upgrades, which can be done in a few hours outside of some of the more grindy achievements.

137856011,1155330,"One of these days I'll be able to write a review without comparing a game to X-com, but today isn't that day.   There's a whole lot to like about Showgunners, and a few very minor quibbles that are worth mentioning; but on the whole I would wholeheartedly recommend Showgunners as the next game to scratch the tactical shooter gaming itch (In particular; if you were a fan of X-Com Chimera Squad).   Starting with the good; the core gameplay loop is great. The variety in enemies, abilities, and maps feels solid as your squad moves from arena to arena. Weapon selection can make or break certain fights, and there's a good variety of small puzzles to break up the back to back fighting that the game presents.   While the story was pretty predictable, I did really enjoy it the same way one enjoys an action movie; you're not here for the crazy twists, but rather to have a great time where you can shut your brain off for a while. To the game's credit, the voice acting is pretty good, and there's some great moments in the writing that make your different companions feel unique despite their tragic back stories.   I mention XC: Chimera as the game that this shares a lot of DNA with; in that they did a great job making the characters feel unique; yet balanced and distinct. Based on your playstyle, there will be a reason to mix and match your squad and while some combinations feel particularly strong, nobody feels like they're a bad choice to bring along. That's pretty darn great.   On a related negative however, it's a little unfortunate that maxing out your XP means getting every ability (as opposed to making choices down a talent tree). In addition by the end of the game, you generally have enough money to buy whatever you want so in terms of 'gameplay choices'; there isn't much variation there. The melee beatstick is generally always going to be the same sort of melee beatstick by the end of the game, the tank will generally always play the same way, etc... Unlike other games like this, the only real branching choice you make is in sponsorships which doesn't feel like enough of a reason to play the game again.   On other minor quibbles, I wish there was an undo button for movement; but turn-by-turn autosaves basically do that if you're not playing on ironman. It's minor, but it is frustrating when you accidentally click on the wrong space or mistime a click during an exploration puzzle. That said, the UI's great and after getting the hang of how things were displayed on screen.   Due to the variety of weapons, I would have also liked some way of either filtering things or even marking the relative power levels of your equipment. Looking at a page of guns that you can't tell apart without mousing over them means having to juggle things in your mind when deciding which weapons to donate, vs. which ones to keep in case you come up on a fight that you may want something for.   I did encounter one bug during one of the game's cutscenes near the end, but otherwise the game ran solidly with no hiccups. Graphics, sound, music, controls are all great, and suggests it was well tested before release.   But like I said; minor quibbles. On the whole, I had a great time with Showgunners, and I would 100% recommend it. The story does a great job of hitting that Robocop-esque dystopian levels of over the top/ yet still kinda hauntingly funny tone, the gameplay is excellent and thoughtful, and while I think the experience is a little short and lacking in replayability; the price point more than makes up for seeing this as an excellent way to enjoy a different flavor of grid based tactic gameplay.",1
137855391,1155330,"Showgunners is a fun Squad tactics game and in function its very similiar to Mutant Year Zero. You are a contestant in a rather murderous TV-show along with 100 other contestants and your job is to survive to the very end. Your journey takes you through several different zones, each of which is an episode in the Homicidal All-stars TV show and your opponents are rather ridiculous deadly traps and death row inmates (or more honestly that 1 collectible fan or lootboxs which you just cant god damn find from the level area). Stakes are high, supply of Synthsteaks is low, tv host is annoying and violence is guaranteed.  Your primary character and the protagonist Scarlet joins the show for vengeance. A death row inmate she is very interested in escaped punishment by becoming a defender in the show and that is a big no no for her. During her journey she meets a whole group of other characters who are also participating for their personal reasons.. be it money, fame, shits&giggles or just avoiding (more)guaranteed death. All characters have their own personal weapons and abilities, forming a familiar roster of  assaulter, heavy support, trickster, tank, utility and sniper.  Game happens in 3 phases. During your time outside the zone stages you spend it talking to other contesters or preparing yourself for the next zone. In zones you are moving in a maze riddled with traps, puzzles, ambushes, lootboxes and either optional or mandatory combat fields and your objective is to survive to the end. All combats and lootboxes provide you with loot, exp, money and fame. Fame you use like a milestone resource and depending on your answers to your fans or interviewers who have come to watch the show in live, you can the use fame to unlock boons like extra money, exp or special items.  Combat plays like any squad tactics combat game. The usual X-com mechanics where you try to outflank your enemies, throw a dice will you hit or not and use comsumable resources or character abilities for your benefit. Sound design is great and attacking has sufficient oompf so it feels satisfying to go melee and beat the hell out of your opponents. Depending on how brutal you are or how you dispatched your opponents the fame you gain from the fights gets slight bonuses. All characters have their own personal weapons and you gain slowly better and better weapons.  What else can i say.. the game is bit on the shorter side but its certainly fun. There is no map randomization so replayability is low but that also means each of them is hand crafted and different from the earlier ones. Character are quite nicely balanced and I ended up using all of them since no one is particularly weak.  Its a good game. If you have an itch and want to scratch it",1

Each Tome adds a few flat stacking bonuses, and 6 researches to your technology pool.  Choose one of 3 random technologies from your technology pool. Research it for a new spell, unit, or building that you can start using immediately (build time and costs not included).   Research 4 technologies, then pick a new Tome. Each Tome adds ~6 new technologies to your technology pool. Repeat.  After picking any 2 tomes of a tier, you unlock the next tier. There are 5 tiers, with the 5th tier having only 6 tomes - one for each affinity. You aren't forced to specialize into a single element until tier 4.

After quite a few elite teams, cross-checking refs, and those damned lettuce heads I've made it. Every game is a hustle and my team is looking great. My boy Angus McShaggy can check like a semi-truck hitting a smart car. Mark Jerky is my go-to for getting the puck down the ice to Calvin Dord, my sniper. Mark Jerky and Stevie Louder move like syrup down a maple tree so I mostly use them to throw hockey sticks at the opposition (yes you read that right).   It's 2nd period with 25 seconds left, score is 2-1 the princesses...time to make a play. Our team wins the face-off and the puck heads right for my speedster Mark, PERFECT. I get the puck down the ice through a storm of fart clouds (no literally). I try to set up the perfect shot by passing the puck around, creating some room for my boy Calvin to take his best shot. He receives the puck, the lane is open, I go for top right of the net. MISS. 14 seconds left!!! The princesses skate their stinky asses down the ice towards our goalie. In a panic, I have my two defense players Stevie and Carlos take aim for the princess with the puck. Stevie throws his stick absolutely beaming the wench behind the princess with the puck. 10 SECONDS LEFT!!    Stevie wanders off to grab his stick while I take control of Carlos. It's only Carlos and McShaggy that are down the ice with the princess who has the puck. If I can take her out and pass it back to Calvin who's waiting at the opposite end I can tie this game up for overtime. Time to clutch up or shut up. The princess with the puck lets a fat one rip as Carlos winds up to let his stick fly. Carlos sends it towards the princess as McShaggy crosses his line of fire. McShaggy goes down, the stick tears down the ice towards my goalie absolutely obliterating him. I laugh hysterically as I witness my boys fall apart like bowling pins to a hockey stick. I see my boy Calvin coming down the ice in an attempt to aid the absolute tragedy that has happened down the ice. The princess winds up, lets a wet-fart out, takes the shot and scores a free goal. 3-1 and 2 seconds left.......  The princesses win the face-off and run the clock as I have yet to stop laughing from the madness that has just occurred in front of me.

137855971,1494420,"Honestly, needs a lot of polish, but as is shows a lot of potential and seems to be genuinely worth investing in!  Cons: 1) As others have stated, the AI needs work. Specifically, in regards to the Harvesters (the big dump trucks that harvest crystals). They practically need to be baby-sat as they sometimes have issues getting into and out of the refineries where they unload the main and only resource you use to build. On top of that, when they are directed towards a resource field, often times because the thing has extremely limited movements (just like in real life) such as having a turning radius of a football field, they will often times miss the resource field entirely. You would think the AI would notice, but what often ends up happening is the AI goes to the location and ""thinks"" it's at a good spot. It then lowers the grinder to harvest, touches the ground, harvests literally nothing, and then goes ""there's nothing here, time to go to the next area, oh wait, there's an area 5 feet from me, let me using my massive *turning radius* to hopefully get on it and try again"" and after a full 60 seconds of forwards/reverse driving, it sets down the harvester and....! It missed again! AI: ""whoopsie! My bad! Let me just-"" NO! You need to baby sit the harvester, make sure it goes *exactly* needs to park it's fat butt, so it can harvest. Thankfully, having 3 harvesters seems to be optimal, and the further they go from the base, the less frequently you need to guide them, but we haven't even gotten to the best part... 2) Cliffs, and by cliffs I mean slightly slanted hills. Some units, especially the non-hover units and non-alien ones, such as the HARVESTER, have high torque, no speed engines. This means, on the maps with dunes and sand hills (every single map) the harvester, unless it builds up momentum, cannot go up any of the hills, making it take forever to get to the destination, or in the worst case scenario, the AI being stuck trying to go up a hill due to bad pathing. This honestly wouldn't be a big issue except another faction has none of these issues. 3) The aliens. Honestly? The aliens are kind of terrible in combat, they only really have 1 good unit: the hunter. The Goliaths do have armour thick enough to where small weapons fire doesn't hurt them, but a single missile launcher basically tears them apart, and they're too slow to do anything. So, why are aliens so broken? Simply put, they have more starting resources, units and they use shrimps: easily killed, workers that are drones from SC2. However, unlike SC2, you can create a cheap, local resource deposit which can be set up with nodes (your definitely not creep tumor) so that the workers can essentially mine a resource, and immediately deposit it 5 feet from the location. Because of this ease and simplicity, and the fact that early on each harvestor costs 3000 resources compared to a shrimp's... 100 resources and how they can immediately farm and get enough resources to make more shrimps, the aliens come with the benefit of mass production. This is expected, however! Because a harvester usually takes a full 30+ seconds to get to it's location, if we assume it immediately farms, turns around, and immediately does a 30+ second return, it will have farmed roughly 9,000 resources, which is a lot! But we also have to account for the long build time of the refinery which then comes with a harvester, and also the harvester spending 1-3 minutes trying to back out of the refinery, and back into it as well. In the meantime, the aliens get locked into a quadratic equation of building small creation pools, not to mention they start with 5 shrimps, spamming more shrimps, and by the time your first harvester returns with resources, the aliens not only started with more units that they likely immediately sent to bum rush you with, the aliens also likely have probably 4-6x your economic power and are already researching Tier 3 units. I time myself, and by the time I was trying to build an Ultra Heavy Vehicle Factory, my aliens already had 20 goliaths, and had 10 greater cysts spamming 10 goliaths every 120 seconds (the strongest alien unit).  Pros: 1) This game, beyond polishing issues, basically delivers absolutely everything you could ask for. 2) Despite the aliens being a massive powerhouse, if the humans know how to perfectly macro and micro the few units they can defend with early on, by trying to perfectly kite the initial rush of aliens led by the hunter, the mere fact that they have access to ranged stopping power makes it nearly impossible for them to lose. You either get cheesed by literally mountains of bodies, or cheese them with an armada of missiles and railgun tanks which hold the line until you have enough to 1-shot a goliath. 3) Playing against an alien may seem oppressive, but if you get 2 human commanders, each with 1 or 2 players helping them in fps mode, up against a single alien commander with maybe 1, max 2 allies in fps mode, the game changes drastically! It becomes the alien trying to eliminate the human race, it feels thematic, the humans banding together, them trying to help each other, holding the line, while the aliens look for a weakness, growing in strength and the moment they find an exploit, fully rushing the humans. It may not be balanced, but it can certainly be VERY entertaining! 4) While the Cons may seem like a massive ""this is bad!"", it already seems like some basic QoL changes occurred. For example, if a harvester gets stuck, click on the harvester, right click it to ""path"" to the refinery it is stuck in, and it will go to the default position of being inside the refinery. Let it leave through it's normal exit, and it works! In addition, make sure that any resource fields they go after, is completely on flat ground! If it's flat, they tend to handle the situation quite well! If it's on or near a slight hill, god bless that harvester. 5) The fps mode is sick. The QoL features such as teleporting to the battlefield so that you can get in a tank on the field, is just amazing. Given how much is going on and the quality of the graphics, it's actually running quite well! With me being ever so slightly above the recommended specs, I run it with ease! Occasionally there is a spike, but that's mostly in the very large battles. 6) Many others already said this, but the night time battles? Especially in FPS mode? It's literally *chefs kiss*. The tracer rounds being sent not only help the regular players figure out where enemies are due to allied AI firing at enemies, but it becomes a light show with fireworks, you see everything just blasting, and it's absolutely thrilling! The aliens tend to be a ""shoot from a distance and you're fine"" enemy, but when it's dark they're nearly invisible, and by the time you see them, they've already gotten close enough to be in CQC and start overrunning your defenses. 7) The aliens can LATCH on to things! Something I felt that was never done right, a crab CAN latch on to a harvester, climb on top of the harvester, and just keep jabbing it's grubby little claws doing a tiny tick of damage every single time! Since there is the risk of friendly fire, you have to be very careful not to damage your own harvester too badly trying to rid it of the pesky crab. You would think it stops there, but even Goliaths are free to do this, although it rarely helps. Another moment is a horned crab runs up to a barracks which has a defensive structure, climbs up one of the sides of the building where no defensive weapons has visual/firing range on, and just keep nomming on the building for free! It's infuriating as a human player, but so satisfying and accurate for an alien! It's all these tiny details that tend to add up and make the game not only unique enough to stand out in this genre, but something that might even revive the genre entirely!  So, all in all, I give it an 8.6/10, with cons fixed, a 9.3/10 or higher. It's genuinely that good! :)",1

137856105,2311190,"This is the best fucking game on the planet.  No, but seriously, this series has proven to me and many others that you can just make a ""quirky indie horror"" with a faceless, silent protagonist, uninspired monster designs, and whatever the humor is supposed to be- and make bank. The only mildly funny scene in this one is the car scene, which throws so many things rapid-fire at you with only one or two things landing at most. The rest of the time, I was laughing at the game, not with it.  The physics would make Portal vomit and GMod enter a frenzy. The platforming would make Mario go cliff diving. The curse of the Mascot Horror Giant Pit makes its grand return in multiple sections of the game, including both the boss fight near the end and the main traversal method throughout the entire game. Not only is an entire section is ripped directly from the second game with a different playstyle slapped on it, but it's one of the worst, most tedious parts of the second game- the cannon section. The new designs are... unique at best, with Nabnaleena being a stand-out in terms of absolute unashamed laziness, and no optimizations are made for these models. No, not even the billion polygon spider and his new billion polygon wife.  The game is obviously stretched out to the 2 hour mark, with the aforementioned reused segment from Banban 2 being an obvious indicator. Some more subtle things to boost the playtime are the boss against that weird dino-chameleon-hydra-thing, the spider wedding, having to push that weird robot thing all the way to the Opiloid, having to go all the way back through the boss arena to get the party hats for said weird robot thing if you die directly after, the series of six or seven doors before the aforementioned boss, the unskippable Stinger Flynn cutscenes (all three of them), the rather confusing Nabnaleena surgery segment, the list goes on and on.  Honestly, I wanted to believe the Euphoric Brothers could improve Banban to genuinely be worthy of praise. That hope died out the second Game 2's first trailer dropped in February, and it died again when Game 2 actually dropped in March. I still hope they do end up bettering the Banban series some-fucking-how, but that's just a tiny part of my brain grasping at straws. The game's ass. Some people just aren't cut out to make horror, and that's a harsh part of the industry to accept.  I will be buying and playing Banban IV when it comes out, but only out of morbid curiosity. It might get better with the more unique character designs alluded to at the end of this chapter, and it might get worse. I know the polygon count will.",0

I've played for just under 80 minutes and I've pretty much seen the lot. Look at the playtime on every review. I only counted 2 over 2hrs at time of posting.  I have quite a few complaints apart from that, but they mostly boil down to ""there isn't enough content"" -There are 2 skills of each damage type, and the two characters each start with one. Meaning, the only correct play with the characters, is to get their other damage type then buff for that type. Your build is either correct or wrong, there's not really room for creativity. (IE, with the rapid fire robot get the other rapid fire skill then build for rapid fire) -After a victory in the first hour, was entirely disappointed that finishing the level doesn't even result in a boss battle, just a larger area to mine and a victory without fanfare. If you can get to 25, you can finish the level, simple as that -My unlocked achievements seemed to un-unlock after closing the game, maybe that's intended but it's not really clear either way. -The fact that the player takes an active role in spawning enemies means that once you get a good build, you can only die if you move too quickly.",0

137858439,1669000,"It's a great combat-oriented x4, maybe one of the best ones (top 5) out there.  THE GOOD * Combat is very well done. Imagine if total war battles were turn based, had tiles (hexes), and used spells. It adds enough depth to your usual x4 ""unit X attacks unit Y, see results"" without it becoming overly complicated. * Customization of your civ/faction/leader is also well done. I was able to make multiple custom factions that I felt had different synergies and played very uniquely from each other. Some of the customization options were a tad lacking (mostly picking armor colors) but there are already mods for that. * Because the customization and combat work so well with each other, it made it easier to role play your leader/faction and become more immersed.  THE DIFFERENT * Buildings and unit recruitment use different production queues, which I liked, but also felt it took some interesting choices away.  * It is combat oriented, don't expect any diplomacy/culture/religion/etc victory conditions. To win each map you either A) Conquer everyone, B) Settle/absorb enough cities to cover a certain amount of the map, and then defend your territory for 15 turns, or C) build 3 ""science"" buildings and then defend those for 15 turns. All 3 end up with 99% of the AIs hating you no matter how good your relationship was beforehand. * There is an underground portion of the map, but I feel it's very underutilized. It would make for interesting play if the AI used it to secretly move troops, or if the underground could affect things above ground (or vice versa). As it stands it's serviceable but you can largely ignore it. * There are a lot of free cities/city states by default. Good because it means more AI interactions and intrigue, bad because it's very hard to expand your empire without becoming evil and conquering them, or waiting for a large potion of the game for them to like you enough to be absorbed.  THE BAD * Naval combat is very bare bones, and most of the maps don't feature a lot of water, so a majority of your combat will be land based. * Battle maps need more variations. I can't tell you how many times I've fought on the same ""farm"" battle map, and I've only completed 3 games. * Due to the limited victory conditions a lot of your games will feel very similar despite the customization available ie what research you focus, your build order, what units go into your army, and what spells you use. * In the 10 hours I've played the game has crashed twice, both times locking up my PC and making me hard restart it. Not cool. I've also encountered a bug where my faction leader will be contacted from the astral sea (main menu) by.... herself? I get the intention, it's neat if you have some faction leaders ""sitting on the bench"" and they reach out to help, but maybe make sure they're not already in the game first. * There are a few ""staple"" unit roles missing from the roster. Where are the siege engines? Melee mages? Spies or diplomats? Traders?  Why are calvary so limited that unless you pick a certain faction origin and also specialize in them, you don't get any at all?

For starters the game is very simple and simple I mean the game downloads in less than 5 minutes and you are ready to play. Now when you enter the game you hit the ""lobby"" and you are asked are you playing with a keyboard or Controller? You have 2 options. when you are done selecting what you want you can OR SKIP by *pressing ESC* play the tutorial and the tutorial is VERY EASY. At least for me..   I've only played for 23 minutes and I like the game. It's got the PA announcer organ sounds and sticks and puck audio also they sound decent.   As far as $20 or $17 on sale No not worth it should be like 10-13 range..   Can you compare this game to NHL23 EA SPORTS No! this is more of an arcade game mode.   There are also no rules in the game so no penalty's or anything! keep that in mind.  Overall I'd give it a 7/10 not to shabby!",1

The RTS portion felt fantastic to me. a few issues being the harvesters need better pathing so they get off their platforms quicker and dont get hung up on other harvesters.  As i continue to dive into this game with friends i hope to see this game take off and find a spot among the great games we already enjoy.   Till the next victory gamers!",1
137858780,1494420,"Ok, so I feel like making a list right now.  The issues: 1. No in-lobby way to switch roles, mostly a problem due to the fact that when the restart option is chosen after a match, everyone in the lobby except for the host is set to observer,forcing them to leave and rejoin.  2. Playing as human infantry is not very fun.   If you don't get a vehicle quickly, you will have to walk everywhere, and this game's scale is so big, it is literally faster to wait for the commander to build vehicles than it is to just walk anywhere.  3. Harvesters are as dumb as the rocks they harvest.  They have such terrible pathing issues, they spend more time backing up, but not far enough, and then running back into some rocks, causing them to back up again, then they do mining.  This is so bad, it literally serves as a strategic advantage to the aliens, whose smaller, terrain climbing shrimps have no such problems.   4. The game has MASSIVE scale, but it really doesn't seem like it takes much advantage of it.  The way the AI and the unit building systems work, you will never have massive armies clashing, and none of the units are big enough (except maybe the harvester) to really feel like they had to have a big map to accommodate them.  Don't get me wrong, the big map's great, it just feels like it was made for a different game.   5. Pathing.  Human units are a bit better about this (though not much), but sometimes units will take a  long way around nothing at all to get to their destination, or refuse to attack units until they are right on top of them.  Scouts seem to be agoraphobic sometimes, and crabs often won't attack unless they have no movement orders.  6. No a-move.  No order to tell the AI to go to a place and stop to murder along the way.  If you tell riflemen to move, they will shoot things along the way, but they will keep walking while doing so.  If you tell crabs to move, they will receive tunnel vision of the highest order.  7. No voice chat(?) if there is, I have somehow managed to miss it.  8. Performance.  This game tends to lag a bit.  Not too badly for me, but some people are having BIG problems.  9. Cancelling construction of a unit does not refund the material cost.  This is probably a bug.  The reasons why I am recommending this game despite those: 1. Playing commander is awesome, especially with other players.  I love playing an RTS in which I don't have to micromanage ALL of my units, but rather feel like I'm really giving orders.  Sure, the player might just ignore you, but even if they do, they're not just sitting around doing nothing without your eyes on them.   2. Playing alien is the best!  Whether commander or crab, being on the side of the Giant Enemy Crabs has never been a bad idea before.  They have fewer movement options than the humans (pretty much just the Hunter), but a lot more movement versatility.  They can scramble beneath the ground, upon a hill, on the back of the human's vehicle, on top of the human's buildings, all to keep themselves out of the direct firing line of the humans' superior munitions.  For the best experience this game has to offer, I would recommend playing as the goliath. You won't regret it.   3.  It's a wonderful premise. I loved commanding because it felt like I was giving my teammates new toys for their FPS gameplay, and I loved FPS because it felt like I was fighting for the commander to build me new toys.   For as slow as it is to start, the actual gunplay works very well. 4.  This game looks amazing.  Even on that one map with the constant toxic thunderstorm, this game looks phenomenal, on both views, and I'm not even playing on the highest graphical quality.  Turning down the quality reduces the lag for me, but honestly it looks so good on high (as opposed to medium or ultra) that I genuinely consider the appearance to be worth the little lag it brings.  I am not a game developer, but I can think of a few ways the core gameplay may be made better.  The slowness is the biggest issue:  I think having some other option than blindly teleporting to a location on the map from a teleporter whose location is not necessarily obvious is essential.  As much as I like the idea of going to different buildings in FPS mode to get different things, the scale is so huge that it is just an annoying hike right now.  Maybe have special teleporters in all of the buildings that connect to each other like elevators, and maybe be able to build special outposts of some kind that connect to this network and can be teleported to as well to quickly resupply the front lines.  This would solve the issue of how bloody slow the infantry are compared to the size of the map while still fitting the theme.  Transport vehicles would also be nice, but I'd imagine that would take longer to implement.  Aliens could have something similar with like some kind of Nydus Worm-esque biological horror.  Overall, the game has impressive scale and what is here is fun, but it needs something to fill that scale.  It needs something to fill that void, that empty space.  It needs bigger armies. It needs bigger machines.  It needs bigger giant enemy crabs!  It needs a better way to travel.  This is a good game, and it is fun to play right now, but it needs more.  If the benefits I have listed do not outweigh the downsides I have listed, then it's probably not for you quite yet.  I trust these issues will be fixed. I hope my trust is not misplaced.",1

137858252,1494420,"For me, I tried to play the single player version, upon logging in the game was so stuttery and choppy I couldnt even play or manage to get much beyond the spawn point.  I tried reducing all settings to absolute ground zero, same.  I tried to verify files same, nivida drivers fresh that morning..  Now before some might say well its your potato of a system, this is 3.5k alienware that pushes 3 to 4 triple AAA games on 3 gaming screens without a hitch.  It pushes Star Citizen (cough_ most unoptimized game known to man and cpu intensive) without a hitch.  So its not the rig.  Something is inherently broken with this game, which is sad because I really wanted to give it a shot and play it.  Perhaps whatever this is will be worked out down the line but for now, game is unplayable.",0
137857858,1494420,"try it out be a bug or play as a human using better weapons and units as you fight for your commander or even be your own commander have players fight for you.

137857153,1494420,"Lots of potential but as of now, I can't recommend it unless you have friends and are playing on a server against others. ------------------------------------------------------------ An example of a game trying to do too much instead of focusing on one mode. (Strategy)  - With the current state of the game the maps are too big, once its polished and less buggy and more QoL features are in, then big maps will make sense                      - It takes too long as Alien Commander to Node creep spread its not fun, its hard to tell where you can place them. The issues are numerous here. It's not fun. This eats up the majority of the Alien Commanders time, instead of you know... Commanding. No visual creep spreading is disappointing                     - No human roads auto connecting to each other as well when building builds is disappointing and would solve the Harvester bugs that are also numerous  I could spend Hours talking about whats wrong here or whats missing but i'm not. I just don't have the energy and other people are calling it out.",0
137857065,1494420,"I highly recommend this game! It is absolutely fantastic and tons of fun. It reminds me of deserts of Kharak, but you have your friends play as your units.

Pros: - Lots of heroes - Three Kingdoms - Very free to play friendly - Lots of towns to take over and build - Easy to pick up and play - Upgrade weapons, armor, tactics and more - Crafting system - Town builder - Lots more  Cons: - Does have some pay walls to increase your heroes faster or obtain them quicker - Ping issues - Map issues - Sometimes bandits will appear a level but then poof when you hit them higher and defeat you - Low playerbase at the moment, get on here people!   I easily recommend this to at least try it, you don't have to buy it or anything like that, pick at it every day or other day and have fun, get some friends and play together.

137858089,1824960,"[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2[/h1]  You can view my full review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/wra6sdpLqhk  This is a must buy VR experience. It is very polished. It looks great, runs great, & has great sound design. I wouldn't call it a Resident Evil clone, but it definitely has some inspiration from it. It's dark, it's atmospheric, you kill lots of zombies, & there are some light puzzles in between. The action is slow-paced, but very intense.  Even though this game was also released on the Meta Quest storefront, it has not been nerfed at all for PCVR. It is a great PCVR game. It took me a little over 4 hours to beat the game on medium difficulty. I had a blast throughout.  It's not a perfect game. I did have some minor complaints, but overall  it's just a great game. Game is running on the Unreal Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting a steady 90 fps on high graphical settings with super sampling set to 118%. You have full locomotion or teleportation available, along with smooth or snap turning. You can play standing or comfortably seated as you have button crouch and magnet hands.  Wanadev Studio has released 3 VR games and each one of them has been very good. Wanadev is becoming the best VR dev team out there. Now I just want to know ... when is part 2 coming out?

The puzzles are well put together, though I feel like the escape room could have been more lenient and the nabaleena segment was reminiscent of FNAF's gameplay loop of battery drainage, though it was definitely padding out for time. I feel if they put more time into the next game it'll be really good.  If you're someone who just wants to have a fun time without the need for 24/7 scares then this is the game for you.

137858978,2272970,"I haven't gotten too far as of writing this review (i believe im at the third major checkpoint) but this is a very nice game from what I've played.  The game's atmosphere is its triumph, very reminiscent of games like Omori and Oneshot, and the horror elements are done well. Everywhere you go you feel on edge, and something as slight as a change in environmental sound can make you feel unsafe (for me at least, I'm not exactly the bravest soul out there lol). So far there are no major jumpscares, which is nice since I'm not really a fan of them anyway, plus they aren't really necessary when the atmosphere and monsters are already unsettling. If you die, you go right back to the checkpoint no questions asked.  The game controls fairly well and feels nice, though when climbing walls (performed by pressing diagonal up near a wall) its very easy to accidentally climb the wall (performed by holding diagonal up) when you are trying to just hold onto the wall, so you have to very quickly tap the input so you don't accidentally jump up the wall.  Finally, the artstyle compliment the eerie tone and atmosphere very well. The monsters so far are eldritch beings terrifying to behold, and the game being portrayed in grayscale and darkness makes the world feel much more unnatural. Also the protagonist character is really charming and has some cute animations (try pressing left and right really fast it's funny).  Overall first impressions are very positive! I'll be sure to update this review when i finish the game. As of right now I believe its a fun little indie game that's worth your time.",1

After a few hours when the game first came out I got so bored that even turning off my brain to try and enjoy it didnt work and with all the disconnections the game suffers from it quickly became more frustrating than anything. I recently decided that screw it I may aswell finish the damn thing so i can uninstall it forever. After playing it for about 2 hours I had about 30 disconnections from arkanes servers (note that my connection to everything else is fine and has suffered no interruptions). When you dc the game kicks you to the main menu and when you resume the checkpoint system is total crap meaning you are often treading the same path every time you reconnect.  I just cannot even fathom of how ANYONE thought this game was remotely ready or even passable as a game it just sucks at just about everything it sets out to do and the only plus i can give it is at least the guns feel good. Arkane should be ashamed to have this thing in their released games list and some people should definitely be fired over it,0

137861486,1155330,"A well made, functional and fun PC game in 2023? Pinch me I must be dreaming. Game is exactly as advertised on the tin. A fun turn based strategy/action RPG. Game functions perfectly so far with a pleasant and responsive UI, decent graphics with fair options to tweak in the menu to get performance where you want it. Rock solid 144fps on a 3080/3900x, but your mileage may vary. Thankfully has upscaling options to compensate for lower end hardware.   The game itself from a gameplay perspective is fun if a bit shallow. Skill trees on the first two characters (so far) dont appear to offer much in terms of build diversity. But the very important caveat is I just finished the second mission so more options could open up later. But what is visible to me now is pretty shallow. The game is also pretty easy on Normal. Id recommend going up to hard if youve played games in this genre before.  The overall theme/story is very B-movie schlock but I enjoy it so far. The announcer can be a bit chatty but the devs have helpfully included options to tone him down if you want. But yeah the overall vibe of the game is fun and I enjoy it. Enemy variety has been good so far. They introduce 1-2 new enemy types per mission so far. Unsure if that continues through the end of the game.   I will say that the camera can be a bit annoying sometimes since its at a fixed angle. Can sometimes make it hard to see what you want in the third person traversal sections, and during combat you often cant zoom out far enough to see all the enemies on the field, or a weird camera angle may cause a misclick every now and then.   Overall I recommend it if youre looking to scratch that turn based strategy itch and want to support devs who release a finished, functional product for a reasonable price. We need more of this and I hope this game does well for them.",1
137861415,1155330,"Showgunners is a fun little gem. It's like XCOM with a B-Movie plot about getting revenge on a megacorp that hosts modern gladiatorial games. I like the character design a lot, with each teammate having a well-defined role, though I wish each character had different build paths for the sake of variety. The game could also really use a new game plus where you unlock characters from the beginning, or in a variable order compared to the first playthrough. The story is pretty goofy/shallow and it's hard to connect or get invested in any of the characters, but it's not detractive to the gameplay.

The complete lack of any commentary during games or music means youre playing in a deathly silence mostly which really doesn't liven up the game when you are trying and failing to beat AI that feels really scummy. The controls for keyboard aren't very good, which you'd think wouldn't be a problem except you CANNOT REMAP THEM. So you are stuck with that. Controller is the same situation. The physics are wonky which while funny also means the puck can morph through the net sometimes which feels really bad in a game THIS HARD. Being robbed of, or AI getting undeserved, goals is just an unfun experience in a game this shallow.

How Bohemia chooses to treat both players bases from this point forward will cause the game to bloom or wilt.   -AI needs improvement. -Several character animations need to be worked out. -A better ""controls"" setting(Couldn't find one). -More game modes wouldn't hurt(Co-op campaigns).",1

So i finished playing for the night, and started it up tonight (there is no save feature, so I got to the end of a chapter then got off there). When I started up again, the game repeated ALL of the events from the previous chapter again, except for story events. I had a few random story events come up, but literally everything else was exactly the same as what I had seen the night prior. Thinking maybe it had a weird quirk with where I loaded, I tried reloading, where upon I got an event from back in chapter 2 (currently on 6). There is zero reason that event should be playing as it no longer makes any chronological sense. As a last resort, I used the reset button to reset everything since the start of the current chapter. I was still only getting repeat events, only this time there were no story events in between. And that's where I stopped. It doesn't matter how good the atmosphere, characters, setting, art or anything is. If I'm suddenly getting thrown back and repeating events I already know the outcome of, I just can't stay invested in it.  Maybe I'll try the game again if they fix this, but I'm extremely disappointed as I was really looking forward to getting back into it today.",0

E.g. turn-based strategy, deckbuilder, roguelite, base building, colony management, elements of games like forager and even tetris.  It is a convoluted mess and not really fun to play: A good strategy game needs the ability to plan ahead without to much ressource randomization, here ressources as well as ressource collecting buildings are more or less random as well as the structure of said ressource titles, which is important since aforementioned ressource collectors can only collect from adjacent titles. Combine that with the fact, that aquiring new land can deplete one specific, already collected ressource entirly through negative, randomized aspects you have to choose from, then you don't have fun. And since building cards are consumed on use and there is no option the destory buildings once placed, you cannot even redesign you initial layout. The only way is to destroy those buildings with spells on purpose, which in itself is nonsense.  And there is more stuff that is just over-complicated, without any real value for the player.

The main consensus is that the gameplay and writing suck.   Sometimes the writing is funny but given how it's integrated into the game, through the main story moments or pop-up events, there's no saving it. The pop-up events can make shit just happen out of order, so sometimes it's completely lost on the player. Personally, I've only had one or two instances of this but it was jarring to say the least. Translation errors are forgivable since they're comical but lines being said by the wrong characters is awful even if it only happens rarely. Finally, I'm not against Isekai stuff and own the fact that I have completely trash taste but some of the plot points are straight up idiotic (The worst offender is the sleeping one, I think it's mentioned in the top review).  I somehow don't hate the gameplay, I actually have some fun with it. I don't know what is wrong with my brain for that to happen but I almost prefer it over turn-based combat, which was in the original Sakura Dungeon. The major complaints I have are: that new party members always start at level 1 and that you can only take one party member into a dungeon. There's a work around for the first complaint in quests which can cut out most grinding you'd have to do and the second complaint isn't a deal breaker for me. For everything else though, I get why someone would hate it, absolutely nothing is explained to you. Basically all you're told is that it's a match three system with elements, after that you better find everything out for yourself and I mean EVERYTHING. The descriptions of skills and skill gems straight up lie to you sometimes, barely any numbers are given to you for anything besides stats, which are cumbersome to compare between characters without levelling. If you can't figure anything out, or have no patience, you'd hate it and probably find it impossibly difficult. I might be psychotic but I played enough to actually know what I'm doing on nightmare mode and I find it fun. Since I suck and can't mod the game to have accurate descriptions, stat growth numbers or a good tutorial, I might make a guide for other people who wish to endure this for the sweet CGs and 100% achievements.  The art/CGs are definitely the saving grace of this game and probably the only thing I'd say is great. Overall, this game is trash tier but I'm a trash tier person, I'd say buy it on sale if it looks like your type of deal and you're a masochist.",1

137864338,1669000,"Okay. I am sorry to say this, but I will have to. I have played AOW for almost 20 years and had high expectations from this game, and as I said in my review of AOW 3, that game placed the bar very high, which means that Triumph Studies had to work thrice in order to make a better game.  I love the AOW series because of its exciting campaigns, characters, dialogues and music (especially in AOW2 and some in AOW3). I was hoping that this game would have a decent campaign and exciting story, and, to my surprise, it does not have it at all! Yes, the game has no interesting stories, characters, or campaigns, and basically, the entire game is just a series of random maps I quickly get tired of. There is no feeling of wanting to play ""another turn"" before you go to bed, and most of the thoughts that I had while playing was wishing to beat this map as soon as possible, so hopefully, the next map will be more enjoyable.  Currently, the game does not have any handcrafted maps, and the only way to play this game is to enter a random world which often does not look attractive. The sea exploration/battles seem extremely boring and unnecessary (for example, compare it to Disciples 2, where seafaring was extremely thrilling). I also want to question the decisions of Triumph Studio to casual the game by removing workers and settlers' units so that every city can now be built by the heroes. In my opinion, this is a huge downturn into more casual gaming, which is a very bad sign for TBS games. Look at what happened to HMM series, whose developers decided to go similarly.  The series of maps they call a story is the worst-written campaign I have seen in a long time. To me, this is just an insult, for I do not care about random map generators and grinding wheels. I am sorry, Triumph, but I am very disappointed. Because of this, I cannot recommend this game in its current state.  Notwithstanding, I hope that the game improves, and so will my review.",0

137864137,1669000,"AoW4 is everything I hoped for. My first game was a win on the beginner realm using Kruul. It was all the rat kingdom, blight-riddled, good times I could have hoped for.   Tooltips for tooltips make sure you're not scratching your head on any subject. UI is intuitive and mostly not obstructive. On a few occasions I wished I could open other menus before committing to event outcomes. I would really like the empire development to have a filter or search for keywords like ""whisperstone"". Tactical combat is still AoW elite. Triumph has somehow turn the early game into the slow part, and mid through late game breezes by. Really nice change since the early game is where you're always unfamiliar. Well done there.  Had a few stability issues, but they were patched out quickly. Something like 3 crashes in my first 20 turns, but the issues were resolved, and I haven't had another problem since.  Anyone reviewing this negatively with less than 10 hours in needs to give this a fair shot. Or maybe this is the wrong genre for you. The game is too big.

I just finished a run where I made it all the way to the final boss but lost in OT after they scored the tying goal in the last 10 seconds.

137862745,2211730,"Very much scratches a particular itch of mine for a fun shooter with a surprising amount of depth that can be played in small short bursts for quick breaks. There is a wee bit of a learning curve and because your only weapon fires projectiles with travel time rather than hit scan, it does take a couple rounds to really get a feel for but getting through that learning curve has been incredibly fun and satisfying. Tutorial could probably add a mention for the laser beam attack you get when melee'ing the ground and jumping at the same time.  Also works well on the Steam Deck for the most part, barring a weird UI freeze if you fiddle with the settings menu too much. Not too big of a deal since the game's super quick to load up again and it's likely something to do with Proton rather than the game itself, but worth noting anyways.

137864712,2311190,"I'm conflicted. While part of me is impressed that the developers are starting to finally put effort into their series (after all of the backlash), Garten of BanBan 3 is definitely a step in the right direction. However, I still feel that this experience falls short of what it should be (I completed it in 88 minutes).  (((NO SPOILERS)))  What Do I Like: -THE PUZZLES!! They actually improved the puzzles a lot! While some are still the basic fetch quest puzzles, they added more uniqueness to the experience by switching things up with the standard drone puzzles. And they even include puzzles which don't involve the drone at all, which were some of the most fun to understand.  -Iconic-ness. Garten of BanBan 2 lacked what Garten 1 had, which was a memorable ending. Not only is the ending in this game, in my opinion, just as great as BanBan 1. But this game managed to incorporate a few moments which personally stand out in the series.  -That one fight ;)  What Don't I Like: -They obviously, and almost shamelessly, tried to make cutscenes draw on for minutes to artificially bloat the time it takes to beat the game. The cutscenes were decent, but they dragged on an uncomfortable amount of time. And at least 1 or 2 of the puzzles dragged on like this, too  -The game tried being funny in parts, but it just didn't work. They didn't deliver the comedy well and it just fell flat and felt cringe.  -The stinger flynn portion of the game partially reuses parts from Chapter 2. It almost felt a little lazy, to be honest. Wasn't so bad, though  -Obviously the stock assets  Overall, the series is definitely finding its place in the horror genre, and I do think that the series is starting to take off in the right direction. I do think that they should remaster the series from the very beginning and learn from the many mistakes that they've made along the way. Hopefully I'll be able to finally post a positive review on Garten 4",0

137863926,2311190,"""Garden of Banban 3"" is a true gaming masterpiece that will undoubtedly go down in history as a classic. The open world is full of life, and the game mechanics are compelling and diverse, making for a rich and immersive experience. Personally, I loved the open abyss that can be crossed at random - it perfectly symbolizes the sense of confusion and wonder that I felt throughout my playthrough.  The voice acting is exceptional, and the decision to use only three voice actors (one of whom is a developer) adds to the game's uniqueness. Hearing the same voice actor for all the male characters creates a sense of familiarity and comfort.  The puzzles are the true highlight of this game. They are challenging, and often leave you with no idea of what's happening or why, but that just adds to the excitement and sense of discovery. One example is the medical puzzle with Nabnaleena - I was completely lost during the five-minute instructions/ramble, but that made it all the more satisfying when I finally solved it.  Overall, ""Garden of Banban 3"" is one of the greatest video games of all time, and I will definitely be casting my vote for it at this year's game awards.",1
137863894,2311190,"I have to say, I honest to god love this game.  Compared to the 2nd game, there's a lot of fun and interesting concepts brought up and while they could be executed better for sure, (the Nabnaleena section felt painful to play through for the first time and like actual torture), it was still an interesting and fun experience.  I'm wary of the car section, I fear the series taking up a 'too joking' mantle and I hate to see that happen.  The game also felt rushed in that Stinger Flynn's tentacles were modeled or rigged poorly, and the animation bones were clearly visible.  I'd love to see the fourth installment in the series with more care put into it, with more playtesting maybe?  But I dearly loved the experience.  I played it for friends on a stream, and the entire ride was full of laughs, gasps, and general joy (except for the more painful segments.)  Completing a segment felt rewarding and fun.  The soundtrack in this game was also VERY very good, I found myself looking forward to restarting the 'dragon' fight when I lost because the music was so motivating.  While some sections felt overly and extremely padded, coming to the end was nice, and I was excited to set out in the next game with my new little friend.  Again, the game felt extremely rushed though, I'd really prefer to see the next game with more thought put into things like the ease of a puzzle, the flow of a section, the animation in an animation heavy scene, and the attention and optimization of models.  One gripe I can definitely recall while playing the game is that I greatly disliked the kangaroo, she doesn't fit the style of the other characters and felt weirdly placed in, like some kids character.  I genuinely do love this series though, it's become an autistic interest and while the series isn't the best in gameplay, it's still wonderful to me.",1

There are some things that need to be polished and the combo system needs to be tweaked a little. For example, you should be able to do more stuff in the air if you hit the player with your launcher. You only get one hit in the air and that really doesn't sit well with me. There has to be more options in the air. I'm not really a Holo V-tuber fan, but the characters are cute and really appealing. The music is really nice too. The stages are well designed and vibrant for the eye. The game is still very new, so I can't wait to see what they do with it's development and progress going forward. So yes, you should try this game out if you're a fighting game fan or a Hololive fan that wants to support the fandom.",1

I can't wait for more characters and possible mechanics they're going to add. I do have a slight nitpic like grab doing a little too much damage cause if a basic light medium heavy combo is less damage than a simple grab, the grab does too much especially when some CPUs spam it than doing any combo. I would love to see a cinematic super that uses all the meter and does 50 to 60 percent on just hitting the maximum level super or something like Blazblue or Guilty Gear were if you have max meter and the opponent is on low health you can do a instant kill move that is very flashy and cinematic that feels so good to land. I would love to see either of those type of supers  in this game, I love what this game is so far and I can't wait to see more. Keep up the good work.",1

The 2D fighting is extremely satisfying and because it is so responsive with the cancel controls, even I, someone who is not really a fighting game player, can get in and enjoy the complex elements of combat in the game.  This is a game with high accessibility and I would imagine a high skill ceiling, meaning anyone can get into it, and more competitive players will find a lot of room to grow and get better at mastering their mains.  There is also a single-player roguelike story mode that allows you to take branching paths and attempt to get as far in as possible on one health pool across back-to-back fights all the while unlocking items to power you up and running across multiple choice pitfalls, buffs and double-edged swords.  This is a top-notch fan game and one that is of such high quality, that if I didn't know any better, I would say it was official.  Last thing I'll say is for Hololive fans, there is so much love here.

137865036,1294810,"Ok, let me give an honest review of the game... I will note I was given it by a friend because i'll be f**ked if i'm going to pay into this $70 PLUS 30 to 40 more in bonus day 1 addons and listen to Devs complain about losing profits.... but that's not going to be the bulk of this review... actually it isn't even going to be a factor in this review at all. I would like to point out that the $70 price tag is a systemic issue within the greater scope of gaming NOT an issue with this game. Yes this game is one of the first non-playstation games to do this... but it's not something this game created and thus cannot and should not be used when reviewing this game as it on it's own stands. Especially when game pass exists and you can just get the game for $20 for a month (which will be MORE than enough time to beat it) if you don't already regularly purchase Gamepass.  I will delve into actual issues with the game itself and what I like about it. So let me start with what I like.  It's an Arkane game, I can SEE that in the designs and art direction, i'm not going to mistake it for another game like I do with CoD vs Battlefield or Counterstrike or any of the other generic FPS games out on the market right now. I love that it has a personality in it's look and isn't trying to be hyper real making it look like EVERYTHING else on the market. I applaud counter culture art direction like this and wish more studios were willing to push back against the blandness that YOU the gamers are demanding from games. Real looking graphics does not make a good game. It's a game, it's fantasy, there is nothing wrong with not looking real... show off those polygons.. Just don't be almost everything else Redfall is.  Another Thing I do like is characters, except for Jacob. I haven't played as anyone else but Jacob mainly cause I only play this with friends and until the major issues get fixed have 0 drive to play it on my own really. But the character designs and personalities of the other three are great! I love their one liners, I love the diversity and how you can clearly see which skill belongs to which character, even on Jacobs, the game itself has some really solid characters. Even the NPCs are pretty unique in most cases (atleast the important ones).  Things I don't like:   Jacob - I'll come out of the game and say it... he feels like he's a straight (my guess) white male so that people could not say they didn't create a straight white male. I love his voice lines they are really fitting for what and who he is and Yuri Lowenthal as the VA gives it exactly what it's needed to be what he is... but that's the problem... he's a generic soldier. Grizzled from his time in the tours of duty he's been on, super serious all the time, mocks civies for the way they hold their guns, he's literally every soldier character that's existed in every game. Soldier 76, Brimstone from Valorant, the list goes on and on... he has the personality of a block of wood and I think it's sad that he falls so flat... because you can make this concept work... heck I don't hate 76 or Brimstone as characters, and I don't even hate Jacob... he's just... safe. He's a non-offensive soldier stereotype and I while I don't think this game has some 'Go Woke' agenda... I do think that THIS is the paint by numbers character they needed to make to avoid controversy. He's not a bad character, they use him well enough and he has a fair bit of good one liners... but he just feels so bland and safe compared to the rest of the cast.  AI - It's almost non-existent. The AI is terrible, most of them stand there and let me one tap heads even on Midnight mode, they constantly miss... maybe to make up for the fact that if they do hit me, it hurts... the only times i've been killed was from groups randomly spawning behind me and I didn't notice just to have 2 or 3 of them get lucky shots off because I was totally unaware they were there... or by blowing myself up... the Ai is horrible.. but as this game has spurred me on to play the dishonored franchise again... the AI in those wasn't designed for tactical fast paced shooting... so maybe that has something to it? Arkane even if this is a new/small studio... doesn't have the background to do this kind of thing? Except for the existence of Deathloop... but I never played that one so I can't use it as a jumping point.   Performance - This game tanks... I can't begin to say why... though I do suspect Denuvo and I will condemn that program till my dying breath... but yea this is a big one and it hurts the game bad... unless you're running a high end rig this game drops a lot... I don't run a super advanced rig but I can run Cyberpunk 2077 and MANY more intensive games on high settings at 60fps ... this game shouldn't be that bad... but it is... and I run it on the lowest setting and the max setting to get the same issues across the board... and I just can't figure out why.  Loot... The Loot system is weird... I would have almost preferred a crafting/upgrade system to the Borderlands lite system they have... drops are so random... yea I always get stuff of my level but when it's damage upgrade for a lvl 8 weapon is less than a level 3 weapon because that gun has 10% extra damage... it's a little goofy.  The Stake Launcher - this gun is over powered. It makes super clean work of nearly any real threat and is just my go to whenever I get into any scuffle with a vampire, as I can normally one or two tap any of them... I even nuked a Rook out of existence earlier today. The damage from this gun is just so unbalanced it's not even funny. I think the stakes should be harder to get, maybe 5 in total and they only can be recovered at safe houses and possibly Bellwether special units who carry stake guns... and cultists and vampires (unless killed with a stake) should never drop them.  Enemy diversity - There are (to my count) 7 vampire types, not including the 'gods' and for the most part they are very bland... and in a game about vampires they shouldn't be... I expect Vampires to be a challenge like a Tallboy in Dishonored 1, whenever those guys were on sight you KNEW to be careful... I see a vampire I just pull out my stake launcher and move on with my day. This should be ESPECIALLY true with stuff like the special vampires. Rook should have massive aoe attacks, thicker skin for reduced damage, maybe armored to be immune to stakes until you defeat his HP bar, or at least get reduced damage from them, they should also be replaced for the different gods. Like there should be variants unique to each god. Hollow man gets the bruiser, the next one gets the Bishop who is a tactician able to summon thralls (sliightly amped up cultists with slight vampire powers), and the next get a Knight who maybe rides a vehicle of some sort forcing you to  avoid him when he charges... these are just off the top of my head but the summoned special vamp when you p*** off a god should each be unique to that god. Then there should be more clear differences to the lowwer vamps, Shrouds should do more than just block sight at a slight range, maybe they actually cause the are to go dark forcing you to turn on your light to disipate the darkness to get rid of it, also the way the vampires attack needs to be updated, this is more of an AI issue though so that goes back to that topic.  But yea no... that's really about it... the game needs a lot of work... and I think a lot of people are judging it too harshly based SOLELY on that price tag... yes that's certainly an issue and one that needs to be addressed but it's hardly a sin of THIS game... and it's not one that will actually go away because we've already long proven to these developers we'll buy a plethora of 'extras' on day one... so this kind of knee jerk reaction to a $10 price difference isn't going to fix the problem... it's just a bunch of self righteous gamers getting their internet points. I will update when/if the major issues actually get fixed.",0

137866403,1669000,This is a perfectly fine 4X game. If you're on the fence about it wait for a sale but otherwise it's good value for money.,1
137866237,1669000,"So far no crashes, the game plays well, with no crashes encountered in my 7 hours. Great looking game, which brings me back to the Age of Wonder 2, with how well it brings back the nostalgia. The upgraded systems and quality of life are also a welcome addition. Tons to learn and explore in this game. If multiplayer works as well with no crashes, this will be a great game to play with friends.",1
137865995,1669000,"This game does something really well that most games don't. That's when you first are starting out, and you have questions about IE what exactly does 'Fortune' do for my units. Then you have to google and dig around to find the information. Leaving you with more questions than answers. Well this game does a great job of having words and meanings underlined and when you hover over them, they explain what that word is. And so on and so forth until you understand everything completely. I absolutely love it. I haven't had to research how to do anything in this game so far. It's very well explained.",1
137865727,1669000,"Definitely a great game! So much variety in everything, with races, realms, units, magic and cities all have a lot of flavour! Plus so much happening in the world, even when not fighting other players. Really excellent version of 4x fantasy strategy with some really deep turn-based unit combat - plus, if you don't want to turn-base the unit combat, the auto-resolve is actually pretty solid. Only one small thing holding it back, and that is the small amount of instability with online multiplayer. Can be slow, and may need to reconnect from time to time. A little annoying, but just eats some time. Oh! And because of the depth, if you want to understand everything, there is quite a bit of reading potential here. That said, the in game help is really, really well organised with lots of great info. But more info means more reading, at least while learning :-)",1

137864841,1669000,"A beautiful, colorful, and amazing 4X strategy game overflowing with engaging systems to the point that I have no idea where to even start. Age of Wonders 4 is something special, and quite possibly the best 4X strategy game I've played since Stellaris.  Before I say anything else: This game on launch had serious problems for NVIDIA users, where it would crash due to video driver problems. This feels like a huge fumble for an otherwise fantastic game.  I have a weird history with Age of Wonders. I played Age of Wonders 2 first many years ago when I was just a wee bab, and on a crappy EMachines PC or something like that. Unfortunately, I barely played it. Heck, I barely played Age of Wonders 3, and I never played the first game ( or I vaguely remember playing it ). I did give Age of Wonders 3 a few hours of play right before the fourth entry came out, and it's good but also sort of lacking in impact, with weird performance problems despite the game being old now. Age of Wonders 4 basically improves upon everything in 3, and offers nearly endless possibilities especially with the metric TONS of planned content on the horizon!  Age of Wonders 4 features the Stellaris-like ability to create your own empire and culture. You can customize a leader, their appearance, lore, and the race of that empire. The selection is already way too impressive, from basic humans to the more adorable and out there choice of molemen! Then, you have various culture types that affect many gameplay elements, units, and the appearance of your people, from industrious to feudal there is a lot of potential combinations. Every race has access to every culture-type. Don't get me started on the leader customization, it's off the charts. Heck, don't get me started on RACE TRANSFORMATIONS, which are powerful and permanent spells that CHANGE the appearance of your entire race over the course of a match!  Speaking of spells, there's a robust magic system where you research magic via tomes. There are SO MANY TOMES, and each one has a beautifully narrated quote from some character in the world when you select the tome you want. These tomes grant more magic you can use on the world, in battle, or those powerful race transformations that grant excellent bonuses. This is a cool, addictive, and rewarding way to get magical powers. They even grant bonuses that can affect your empire's elemental affinities.  I'm still baffled at how many systems are at play here. You have every good system from many prior 4X strategy games, but refined to a mirror shine. You have so many different NPC monsters to deal with, including monster dens that spawn infestations you have to deal with. You have the underground world, which was in prior games in the series. You have various events that can occur and you can make choices. You have a skill tree with great passive bonuses and buffs for your empire, based around the elements from chaos to life. You can pick up loot to equip on your leader and other heroes you can recruit. There are special, challenging fights in dungeons you can explore on the map, although exploring really just amounts to fighting a single difficult battle inside a cool looking dungeon. Diplomacy is surprisingly rich and full of intrigue, you or your fellow empires can even accrue ""grievances"" against each other that can be used as justification for war. Speaking of diplomacy, you can meet little ""free cities"" that you can have as your vassals if you play nice with them, eventually making them integrate with your empire if you'd like. There is a wealth of systems that combine together so well, and it's shocking how good it is. Heck, we get the same epic, sweeping fantasy soundtrack we know and love from the last games, although I would've loved to hear new or remixed versions of classic songs like this one amazing battle music from Age of Wonders 2. There's too much about Age of Wonders 4 that is good, it even does away with the weird floaty and low impact feel of combat from Age of Wonders 3 and Planetfall. It's an improvement across the board to all systems, graphics, sound, and gameplay!  The only problem is that there isn't really much of a ""story"" to speak of. There is a story mode you can play, but it highlights the problem with this game. Each empire that is premade has great lore, but it's all just basically interchangeable parts. Interchangeable cultures, appearances, and pieces like a puzzle. For instance, the industrious culture basically is the same no matter what race you choose for it, wearing the same dwarf-looking armor and building sort of dwarf looking cities. The units are also the same depending on these culture choices, no matter what race you choose. I don't blame them for making it this way, there's so many parts and so many races to choose from, that making various bits and bobs that can be swapped out is the easiest option. Work smarter, not harder, when it comes to game development!  Age of Wonders 4 is a game I can see myself playing for hours and hours. It is engaging, rewarding, beautiful, and a great surprise release in the 4X strategy pantheon! Enjoy!",1
137864766,1669000,"Very fun and easy to learn game! Interactive platforming, with tons of differing lore and situations!",1
137865821,1651490,Very cute game with lots of customisation potential. I get the sims vibes with it.,1
137866620,1566200,"Masterpiece. Campaign a bit short, but game itself got some great potential!  Price is a bit to high for the content you get right now, but the roadmap forward will hopefully justify it.",1
137864726,1566200,Super addicting. Can't stop playing,1
137864596,1566200,"Overall the game is quite good, and it is great to see a new hockey game releasing on PC  Pros  Gameplay - The hockey part of the game is very well done Presentation - The game has super good presentation imo Steam Deck Performance - Game runs perfectly, although resolution should be manually adjusted Powerups - Almost all of the powerups feel good to use, and are mostly very well balanced Bugs - My experience was almost bug free, save for a few minor visual bugs and the puck clipping through the back of the net once  Cons  Difficulty - Personal preference, but I found the game a bit too easy Amount of Content - 3 acts, each with 2 elite games, 1 boss game, and 1 either game where you win an upgrade, event, or ""rest"" to upgrade your player before each game. A little slim for me Defence - It can feel a bit odd before you get used to it, but after it is not bad  All of the mentioned issues can be improved upon, and as the game is in EA I would guess more content will be added. Personally, I would recommend adding an Endless mode ,maybe with an online leaderboard, higher difficulty options, more campaign length, some sort of a sliding block and ingame challenges, maybe with cosmetics as rewards. While it would be a stretch, a Franchise mode would be absolutely amazing  Overall super fun game and I cant wait to see what the devs add next",1
137866472,1494420,"Fun concept but not in a playable state at the moment. Too barebone with missing basics functionalities, abysmal performance, tons of bugs and glitches.   Not an enjoyable experience. Come back later if the game keeps being updated and the servers are still active.",0

137865316,1494420,"This game is not functioning.   The ability to join matches depends on random dice. No lobby system, no groups of friends, just hope you are all able to see the same lobbies to play together.   Mechanically it is BARE BONES. Movement is delayed. Commander controls are nearly non existent. No command groups, not attack orders, no formations. Right click at the enemy and hope. If you select a unit and click the mini map you unselect said you unit for commands but it still says they are selected (as an example).   The maps are gigantic and empty. FPS players have a solid 10 minutes of walking to engage the enemy base and with nothing else to do you spend those minutes nearly afk. If you die you are back at base and walking again.   Do I want an RTS/FPS hybrid? Yup. Is this it? This is barely a game. Check back in a few years.",0
137864895,1494420,"Really like the concept!! Dune meets Starship Troopers is epic! Will definitely change my review when there is some more work done but here are the facts as of launch:  -Pathfinding and AI need some serious work. I would say this is the most important issue (even as of launch patch) -Economy and balance need some tweaking (to be expected as it just launched) -Defense: as the economy is real slow; static defenses are a must, but they are absent as of now  Things I would like to see: attack move, less micro for each unit, make early units more impactful to make teching less of an absolute necessity  Overall I am not going to refund the game of course. I think this could be a real gem as long as it gets the love and care it needs. I hope it has success and some more developers are added to the project.",0
137864840,1494420,"It's early access so an incomplete game is to be expected. But for what it is shaping up to be, I think it will be amazing! This game brings back fond memories of Savage: The Battle for Newerth, Command and Conquer: Renegade, and Planetside. So if you are familiar with any of the aforementioned, then you know what you are getting into. Since it is early access, the game is missing some sound, animations, and has a few AI issues. But within the first 2 days of release they had already patched some of the more noticeable issues affecting gameplay itself which is a testament to their commitment. All of that being said, I am having a great time in the online matches and would recommend this to any strategy / FPS lover out there!",1

137865953,1999470,"This cheap little game is a roguelike bullet hell, where you control a guy on his motorcycle, who's been obviously inspired from a Schwartzie in Terminator movies, making asisine but sometimes funny catch phrases - couldn't repress a giggle while hearing some, and the devs seem to have included some other movie inspirations in these, like Pulp Fiction or hum . . . Titanic :))  As for the gameplay, what weirded me out at first is that I had the impression it was a bit imprecise; got used to controlling the chara afterwards, but what may have given me that impression was that weirdly, while some monsters can reach the vertical extremities of the highway, well you can't! Not by much, but it gives a feeling of randomness as for enemy contact or not - I'd appreciate much if the devs would correct that slight defect.  Concerning the graphics and music, well the graphics are simple and colorful, and at least you distinguish the enemies clearly on the screen, which can't always be said for games of this type; the music suits well the graphics, some energic electro rock tunes that feel appropriate and rather nice to listen to,  Well this sure isn't the game of the aeon, but at it's price you can sure fetch it, if you like roguelike shooters - it's one I'd rather play as a casual pastime than anything else - otherwise I am still curious about how the devs will go on with it, not bad if you want to play something without racking your brains out.",1

It's simple: Make a decent game. This was a complete dumpster fire of a game. I have never played something that made me hate it so much. It's an embarrassment that you are even advertising for a 4th installment when THIS is what you think of your fans. This game is nothing but an insult to the very people you ask money from. This could not have possibly been any worse if I took a giant poop on it and smeared it around with my ass.

And let's not even mention the game play that makes you struggle to even comprehend how anyone could find this entertaining. The ""Boss Fights"" (If you can even call them that,) are absolutely ABYSMAL to sit through. They are frustrating to say the least, with terrible power balancing throughout. Sometimes things will kill you instantly, other times it's the easiest thing ever. The shoddy frame rate and the terrible graphics see you dying more times to broken game mechanics then your own failures.  BY FAR the worst installment of this series.

If it were standalone animation, I'd be giving it a thumbs up, but I often had trouble figuring out when moves transitioned into their recovery period, or out of their startup period. Some moves [i]are[/i] really clear visually, but it's inconsistent.  The input buffer had me struggling to do invincible reversals, and REALLY didn't like overlapping inputs; one character I tried has a quarter circle back L+M move, and if I didn't input L and M on the exact same frame I got a completely different move. (And I do mean [i]exact[/i] same frame; the input display showed me getting the wrong move when I was one frame off.)  These two things probably wouldn't have been dealbreakers for me if I enjoyed the general design choices of the game, but nothing clicked with me enough to get me over them.

137869141,1294810,"A couple of months ago, I wrote a positive Steam review for Arkane’s previous title, Deathloop, ending on: “I think there will come a time when we'll look back at Deathloop and wish there were still 'AAA' developers left that're willing to take such risks for the sake of pure creativity.” Who would have thought that Arkane themselves would usher in exactly such a time?  This latest Arkane (Austin) opus is a mess. No, it’s not the ""worst game evar"" that some people proclaim it to be, but [b]it’s uninspired, mechanically simplistic and filled to the brim with bugs, glitches and gameplay systems that just aren’t fun[/b].  [b]Redfall is a game that aspires to mediocrity[/b], but it’s held back by countless bugs, from world meshes that will get you stuck if you dare to explore the world, to erratic or unresponsive AI, to graphical glitches such as fps dips, frequent pop-ins and flickering world shadows (in a game about vampires). [b]If they take the time to fix everything that’s just outright broken in the game, it might be worth 30 or 40 bucks[/b].  But even for a fully fixed Redfall, the 70 bucks price point is simply a ludicrous proposition. [b]The design decisions that make Redfall a mediocre game at heart won’t (and probably can’t) be fixed to such an extent that it warrants paying that price[/b]. The open world exploration is too bland, the fighting feels too floaty, the skills aren’t very interesting and everything else is just too simplistic and uninspired.  Some of the decisions Arkane (Austin) made for Redfall are outright insulting to the customer. For example, cutscenes are exclusively stills of posed character models with voice acting in the background. No actual animations, no lip synching. Look, [b]I’m generally fine with doing something like this as a cost-saving measure for indie devs – but Redfall is a ‘AAA’ game with a 70 bucks asking price[/b]!  The bottom line is: If Arkane manage to patch the game into a fully functional state, it may be worth buying at a SIGNIFICANT discount if you’re into Far-Cry-like games and you’ve played all the good ones already. But [b]in its current state and at its current price point, it’s a definite  “don’t buy this!” from me[/b]. If you haven’t played Arkane’s masterpiece Prey yet, get that instead! If you have played it, then get Deathloop, which isn’t Arkane’s best, but it’s leagues ahead of Redfall.

I bought this game after seeing it on sale for less than a dollar, read the description quickly, and deciding ""Why not, it's only about a dollar""  This game looks very pretty, the graphics can be pretty customized, and I choose mainly high settings and was still getting ~60 fps, albeit I have a 1060 6gb.  The first level really bogged down my fps though, but other than that the other levels were fine.  I like the gun models, they look nice, although the rifle model was a little wonky, and the previews show a revolver for the pistol, but in the game it's this weird sci-fi gun.  The enemies look like they are from either Yo Kai Watch or Power Rangers, I thought they looked cute.  The bullets showing up in the mini-map was a neat touch.  I appreciate the English translation, although I had to find the settings button first to change it from Mandarin.  If you wanted a fun little game to waste time on, and don't mind dropping a dollar, I'd recommend this.",1
137867951,1155330,This game is so awesome. If you liked XCOM at all you will love this. Fun twist in between fights of dodging traps and exploring interesting areas. The story seems super cool too! Definitely have been caught off guard from plot twists even only being 3 hours into the game. Well worth the price and well worth your time as well.,1
137868927,1669000,Feels pretty empty. Some nice touches but too much is left untouched. The tranquility between 'different playstyles' and completing the first 3 very bland maps of the campaign cured me from missing out on real life.  Would probably become a great game with a complete overhaul. Some mechanics do feel in theory to be smooth and accomplished but fail to bring anything exiting to the game in practice.  Was very exited waiting for this and the most i ever payed for a videogame (getting the premium assuming i would like it at least as much as Planetfall). Now i am pretty disappointed an will just look forward to Diablo IV to be released which is at least what III could've been.,0

137868344,1669000,+ Very Good Race and Map Customization + Deep Systems yet not overwhelming + I Like it a lot,1
137868047,1669000,"First off. I want to make it very clear i really am enjoying this game. was a big fan of both age of wonders 3 and planet fall. And gameplay wise this is a good game. Dare i say better that both the previous games in a lot of ways. I like where they went with core mechanics and its fantasy world is amazeballs.   BUT! It has one glaring issue that i think a lot of people will wind up getting disappointed with if youre playing this mostly as a single player game. And thats unfortunately the AI.  So let me explain, the battle AI is actually good and gives you a decent challenge. Its the world map AI that just absolutely blows. I just finished my first run. And again had a lot of fun with it. But when it came to the point where factions were starting to declare war on eachother i started noticing the terrible world map AI.   First off, like in planetfall there are infestation units that will periodically roam the map and attack you and other AI factions until you destroy it. My entire campaign i was the only player actually attacking these Infestations and their nests. The AI Factions would simply just move units near them but never actually attack them unless an infestation came into their borders.  There are also murauding guard units that are stationary that will guard resource nodes rendering them useless until taken out or removed. But the AI factions didnt seem to care about these either. The ai takes provinces but just leave the guards on the resource nodes with out clearing them.  Then theres warfare. I had countless wars pop off in my game. And i watched as my allies would simply just wander unit stacks aimlessly around the map while being at war and never make a move on the enemy. And like wise the enemy never bothered to attack us. I also used scouts to survey lands of two AI that declared war on eachother just to see them both moving units near eachothers cities but never attack eachother.  I only had it twice where in a war with and orc AI where i sent in my armies to take out their capitol and they would spot my armies and counter attack with their own stacks. But that was about as aggressive as i saw the AI on the world map get. And this was on normal difficulty.  So while i really do like this game. As someone whos going to play this game mostly single player. The fact that the world map AI just seems mostly brain dead and not programmed to be aggressive at all during wars, really is disappointing and winds up making games completely boring. I know i never have to worry about defedning my cities in a war because the ai will literally never come attack me. All i have to do is send massive stacks to them. And that just ruins the replay factor this game could otherwise have for me.  I dont really see myself playing many more matches in this game until something is done to tweak the AI in the world map to be better than what it is. So there fore at this time i cant give the game a thumbs up or really justify the money i spent on it even though otherwise the game is great.  If you can look past Poor AI then by all means this game is worth it. just personally i'm not and will not be having as much fun as i could with this game until hopefully the world map AI gets tweaked.",0

137867192,1494420,"Silica has a great concept, its like a mix of Dune/Command & Conquer/Starship troopers. I have always wanted to play a game like this that allows the option of playing RTS or FPS. My comments are only based on the Strategy game mode, I haven't played the other 2 yet so I cant comment on those.  I find the map sizes to be perfect, they allow for the addition of land and air transport vehicles to be introduced by the dev later into development. If the map was too small that you could walk from one side to the other in under a minute without a vehicle, I think the matches would be over too soon and would be rather boring. Vehicle handling feels nice too, doesn't feel arcade like.  Harvester size and movement speed IMO is reasonable and what I would kinda expect from such a large machine, means you manage your resources more wisely as its slower paced for collection. I actually hope the dev doesnt change too much regarding them so long as the AI path finding works. The addition of being able to tell the harvester to actually stop moving when you are in first person so you can board it easy would be nice though (probably will be fixed soon though).  Anyways, general feel of the game isn't too bad for the stage it is at and I'm having moments where I really enjoy it. If the dev can crack out fixes and content updates on a regular basis then I'm sure we will have a gem of a game.  If you are really unsure about buying this game I suggest watching youtube videos of actual gameplay instead of 100% relying on the steam reviews. The youtube videos are what made me buy the game to try it out, and I dont regret it.",1

137867697,1649130,"AI-generated art all over the game!  The game looks nice and 3D models are cute and stylized. But the mechanics are very wonky, you have no way of knowing when you attack is recharged, so you have to randomly press attack button and hope it works.  My main gripe is AI-generated illustrations that have been used for cards illustrations, for loading screen and for promotional materials. Whatever your stance on AI-generated images may be, you can't deny that misplaced mouths, hands that clip into objects and other atrocities look jarring, and in no way they match the style of game. So they didn't even care to fix all of the mistakes that AI generator had made, which tells you about their laziness of greed.  If you care about real human creatives making great art and coming up with original ideas to make games you play more unique - don't buy this game! If you care about human artists getting paid for the ton artwork that goes into making a game - don't buy this game!

I've had it wish listed almost since I heard about it, and I finally sat down to play it. And oh my gosh do I love it.  Everything about it is to love, all of the characters are so fleshed out and lovable in their own way. The story line branching and having however many different endings there are is so fun, and it made me try at least 3 different ways the first time I sat down to play. The mechanics are easy to understand but make for in depth puzzles where you have to use clues from past lines of dialogue and even past playthroughs of the game.   The game itself also seems to carry some heavy tones in its storytelling. There is the obvious commentary on the current world with AI vs Creators, and it is argued solidly in one of the endings. Additionally, I interpreted Skye's [spoiler] plight as depression, not being able to get out of bed, worrying about her self worth if other people (things) can do things better than her, and such. And how she seems to be on the upswing in the true ending, even saying she might just come and work with everyone again. [/spoiler]",1

If you are a Hololive fan and new to fighting games, it's relatively easy to pick up with one button fireballs, easy special move inputs and pretty much every character having some form of light>medium>heavy combo. For more experienced players, the game has a lot of depth and wacky combos to discover.  About the game modes:  Training is very impressive and has most of the features you would expect from a AAA game. I'm a casual player so I can't really point out any features it lacks.  Arcade feels like it's easier to beat with some characters than others, or maybe I'm just better at some of the characters. Either way, difficulty select for the Arcade mode would be nice.  Virtual Frontier is very much like the World of Light from Smash Ultimate, with fights having all sort of different modifiers to spice up the usual gameplay. There's a lot of unlockable items and references to find here. It's a nice challenge!  Online currently doesn't have matchmaking but connecting directly with a friend and duking it out is very seamless. In game, I didn't notice any issues with netcode. That said we were playing on very low ping. The game also encountered an error, but only after about 20 games. In summary, the online works better than in most big fighting game releases on launch.

It becomes slightly more bearable when the rook/nest start to spawn, but even then it's empty; however, when you arrive at the second section of the map it's a whole new game. Enemies no longer die in one shot. The worlds population is amazing, it actually feels like there is mutual combat. I will say this game is far better off in co-op. I wish the game creators would add more variants of the weapons, and possibly some more types. Such as smg,lmg,etc. Also if they made the legendary variants harder to acquire, it would feel more meaningful. I can appreciate that they're somewhat easy to find as you level, but most of them don't hold past two levels. overall it's pretty fun the deeper you go, especially with a partner. I think if they revamped the skill trees, added more life to the first portion, and made more gun variants/types, this game would thrive.

The concept seemed really fun and finally an escape from the zombie forms of games like this and i was really into seeing where they took the story. Unfortunately, the game fell a little flat when it came to what it seemed to advertise.First off right off the bat the game tosses you into fullscreen mode (which is generally the norm) but, forget it if you have a multi monitor display it completely broke everything and DIDNT let you fix the settings before going through a long drawn out frustrating process to either log in or make a new account. If you tried to alter the graphics settings in anyway your picture became all granulated and wonky causing you to have to hard reset the game just to fix it (MAYBE!). In the coop mode there was no text chat all comms, you couldn't join a game in session (even though it only progressed the host's game), the connection was stuttery, if someone d/c'd you needed to go back to lobby by quitting the game (which split up who remained in the party) and had to reinvite everyone once again (again this goes back to the not being able to join a session in progress) and then relaunch hoping that no one would d/c again. There was no loot sharing/trading, everyone was in there own instance (I guess you would call it) which took away from the feel of all being in a group of survivors traversing this vampyric nightmare,  This so far is JUST the coop aspect i haven't even gotten into the general gameplay. For the general gameplay I can only touch on what i saw because after an hour and a half i refunded but there were barely any enemies and the AI was worse than a storm trooper bullet storm shooting at a main character with plot armor. Forget about upping the difficulty it didn't seem to do anything. When you happened to find enemies (and trust me they were few and far between) it was (from what i saw) the same 4 enemies with different gun variants with a few vampires trickled in. It just generally felt clunky and not that great to play. Oh and by the way its a $70 price tag. I'm not sure why we think games releasing like this to, ""Be fixed down the line..."" is acceptable at all. I can understand maybe some bug or hiccups on launch but there should be a team ready and prepared on launch day to hammer out as many issues as possible. This quite frankly seems like a really fun game in theory but with all the issues and feeling like the game isn't even finished for the highest price i ever payed for a BASE GAME variant it is certainly not worth the money.

From my (personal) position the main pros are:  - A fully customizable) and fantasy ruler of great powers which actively participates in his or her victories, so I have someone I can consider being ""myself"" there. :-)  - A big variety of spells, magic and abilities with the possibility to specialize both yourself and your heroes.  - Some extra ""rpg"" events in Crusader Kings like fashion. It is not too deep or long-term (it does not seem they would be remembered and possibly backfire later in some narrative manner) but it is still a welcomed bonus which makes the 4X game more immersive and its characters (including your ""main protagonist"") more ""alive"".  - Beautiful world graphics.  - Turn based combats which can be interesting and fun to perform but can be also automated so you don't have to waste your time with those which are not. Like when you're clearly going to win it.  ---  Alas, there are also some cons. Personally I disliked most:  - Still very poor and primitive ""diplomacy"". I long for a 4X game which will put some ""rpg"" factors in this too, so that my relationships  with other rulers can be deeper and more ""personal"". The closest to this so far was probably Civilization V (not six!) but even there it was far from great.  - While the rulers can be fully customized and are finally in full 3D, graphically - unlike the rest of the world - they are not very nice. At least they were not to my taste.  ---  But in general, the pros far outweigh the cons and it is a good, enjoyable 4X game with some rpg elements and a main ruler, in my favorite fantasy setting.

There is just no signage or help at all for even basic controls.  Then the gameplay, it's so close but just feels rough, even running at 60fps.  Finally it appears to be fine on steam deck, but I had issues with it even booting on the 2nd or 3rd load and it last my progress, dumped me back into the intro dungeon and wouldn't let me quit to the main game. With some more time and QoL fixes I'll buy this again in a shot but refunded for now as it's just too early for it.",0
137871717,2272420,"Loving the sequel, couple bugs and issues though. Lockpicking is slow, when I am trying to sus out the lock and do not manually let it reset, I find it just eats the lockpick and that the angle warranted is quite small. Maybe setting it to be like the first game would help greatly. Pepperspray is too hindering, cannot outwalk the victim and the police will easily catch you. When I got sprayed exiting the window in the junkyard I found it softlocked my game.  Love the new systems, cameras and pickpocketing are really nice; although an issue is that there is not enough NPCs to pickpocket as they have nothing when returning.  I am looking very much forward to the full release and am hoping the inclusion of dogs helps keep it fresh, like the end of the first game",1

137871031,2272420,"Thief Simulator 2: Prologue is a thrilling stealth game that puts you in the shoes of a professional thief. As the title suggests, this is a prologue to the full game, but it still manages to pack quite a punch and give players an exciting sneak peek at what's to come.  The game has you breaking into various houses and buildings to steal valuable items while avoiding detection from security systems, guard dogs, and other obstacles. The gameplay is challenging and rewarding, with each successful heist giving you a sense of satisfaction and progress.  What sets Thief Simulator 2: Prologue apart from other games in the genre is its attention to detail. The environments are beautifully designed, and the sound effects and music add to the immersion. Additionally, there are plenty of tools and gadgets at your disposal, such as lockpicks and hacking devices, that make for creative and dynamic gameplay.  Overall, Thief Simulator 2: Prologue is an impressive sneak peek at what promises to be a fantastic game. It's perfect for fans of stealth games and anyone who wants to step into the shoes of a master thief. Highly recommended.  [h1] This review was generated by the neural network BAI Chat xdd [/h1]",1

137871366,1651490,"Gonna have to say a big NO on this one. I like the idea, but... The simple fact they force feed PRONOUNS into the game. Nope, I do not nor will i ever support any form of wokism. When looking through the options i saw ""pronouns before names"" as an option. Didn't think much of it. Thought maybe it was a game that allowed you to turn pronouns on or off. NOPE. There is no option to turn pronouns off. I do not care about your pronouns, my pronouns or his or her pronouns. You wanna add an option to turn pronouns on for the sensitive people... fine. But forcefully leaving it on and expecting me to except it as is and play it as is. No, I'll spend my money elsewhere that isn't WOKE",0

137870706,1566200,"I highly recommend this rarity that gives us the joy of having hockey game on PC.  Personally I find the AI good enough - enemy AI especially makes the game ""a game"". I would say there are some ironing to do with the friendly AI, although I don't know maybe they do those mistakes by design, but they seriously position poorly at times. The game received an update after first day that already seems to address this.  Lot of reviews complained about progression (mainly the income of rubber - the game currency for unlocks). Now I personally think it is surprisingly wild amounts - I just made a run that lasted until the finals of Act III and gained 81 rubber with that. I unlocked more than half of the superstars. Considering that run took me about 90minutes - it is very generous amount as one more like that, and I'm soon to be finished with unlocking everything. Obviously for players it is awesome, and fun, but might be detrimental and decrease the amount of time people get out of the game.  Overall the action is great, and fun - the devs should be proud of what they have in here.  Some sort of player trading being simulated would be over the top cool thing to have in the future.",1

137870475,1366850,"There are certain expectations for games, especially when they’re from noteworthy publishers, and even when they’re in early access and free to play. Everyone is going to have a different standard, but for me, Jected – Rivals is missing some of the core features that make a game like this worth playing. This is kind of a shame because what is here is actually a pretty fun experience.  Abbreviated Review: https://youtu.be/MjVtlSHpXfM  [h1] Forgot Your Seat Belt [/h1] At first, Jected seems like a fairly standard arcade racer once again set in some desert environment with that familiar “this deadly sport is a popular pastime” aesthetic. It is that, for the most part. However, what spices it up is that you can, at any time you please, launch yourself out of your vehicle and soar through the air. In addition to the general momentum you get from this, you have a rocket pack to gain vertical altitude as well as a jet-powered set of wings that can give propel you forward almost as fast as the vehicle you just left. Both of these have limited fuel but can be used to navigate huge jumps or take advantage of vertical shortcuts around the track.  This makes the relatively simple aspect of racing far more dynamic. Especially when you consider how you’re not just limited to the obvious vertical shortcuts, but whatever you can find with the freedom of flight. Within this unique addition, you can also lasso yourself onto other cars for a boost or pull yourself into one of the various empty cars that may be around the track to give yourself a free ride if yours is on the verge of death. The combination of physics and a fairly decent damage model system usually pushes it to the limit throughout a race – and if it doesn’t survive, you don’t finish.  Car destruction is the basis of another event – a demolition derby. This somewhat small (but diverse) variety of events makes up the “battle royale” design Jected is built. What starts with 18 players in a chaotic melee of gnashing metal is ultimately whittled down to a few through these events for a single winner. You may start by racing, move to a demolition derby, jump to a mode where everyone’s flying through rings, then end with an all-out race for that sole winner. However, whether you win or lose, there’s not a lot to keep you playing.   [h1] Re-Jected [/h1] It’s easy to give games a pass in early access for having a lack of content – in this case only a handful of maps and event types. Even with that though, what is here works well. What doesn’t work is the lack of content beyond the gameplay itself. There are only two drivers for the free-to-play version, and if you buy both the starter and support pack it only brings it to seven. It’s a similar case for the vehicles – which apparently have differences in stats like durability, acceleration, and handling, though none of these are listed anywhere.  However, the real issue is that Jected doesn’t have any sort of progression system associated with this. You don’t currently unlock characters, vehicles, or any sort of customization for those items. There are no paid-for or earned cosmetics, or even stats to follow how much you succeeded or failed. You just have to simply play and enjoy the content that currently exists for the game. It seems weird to complain about something like this, but even Pac-Man had a leaderboard. It’s strange to have a game release these days with no real semblance of progression.  I believe that this would be a decent game worthy of a recommendation if it had the bare minimum of things to earn for doing well or winning. Fall Guys would be a good design to strive for, especially since it uses the same sort of multi-round elimination system. Being able to take the silly nature of this game and express it in characters and cars with customized cosmetics seems like a natural fit and one that would make it a lot easier to play for more than a couple of hours. Also, knowing how well I’ve placed in the competitions I’ve entered and other various stats feels like a crazy omission. I don’t know what’s on the road ahead for this entertaining but thoroughly unfinished game, but I hope they can bring it up to par and build it into something people want to play consistently.

137870262,1824960,Not played this for very long but it seems pretty good so far.  My biggest issue is that there is no multiplayer option like in the first game in the subway.

I've only played a bit so far, but it's a lot of fun and has a ton of potential.  I bought it this evening and can't wait to play co-op with my wife.  Introductory deal gets it for $15?  It's definitely worth that already.",1

137871604,2311190,"Dear reader. I (Very Wealthy Business man Gaming) am a JUMBO fan of the Garten of Banban series, some might say I'm a Jumbo Josher of the series. In my HONEST and HUMBLE opinion I do NOT think Garten of Banban 3 sizes up to the second. However it was still a very amazing experience although I did not enjoy the Jumbo Josh security check cube parkour section, I did enjoy the rest of the game (including the Jumbo Josh x Banban x Stinger flynn 18+ 8 hour sex scene). I would even go as far to say that it was an 8 NZD well spent. When Nabnab got his nabber nabbed off I really felt that! The boss fight made me flaccid! (it was not good!) when that turtle spat sulfuric acid on my NUTS I did not appreciate that, they also tounged me! Other than me getting drugged by a giant psychic tentacle hentai monster (not the drink) MULTIPLE times I had quite the amount of Funfun with Banban,  other than that my last remark is that I loved when Jumbo Josh SMASHED not only a homeless shelter but an orphanage too.  Rest in peace Stinger Flynn Banban Opila Bird and Captain you will be remembered 2023 6th of may - 2023 6th of may  All found dead in horrific car crash of Banban  TLDR: JUMBO JOSH'S COCK IS JUMBO SIZED!!!!!1111!!!!!!!!!!111!!!!!!111!!!!!!!!1!1!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111!!!!!

137873129,2149420,"Overall it's a pretty solid atmospheric shooter. It's got some jank like the kick and cattle prod missing a point blank target 70% of the time, and some of the dinosaurs are a bit less than threatening on release due to slow speeds or weird spawn points, but I had a lot of fun with the game. The guns are fun with multiple fire modes, and there's a pretty good roster of dinosaurs and other prehistoric life to fight. Every level follows a conventional Doom-style keycard progression, and in my opinion all of the level designs were really atmospheric and memorable; The secrets are really hard to find though, I didn't find a single one in my first playthrough. There's about maybe 3 hours of gameplay in the first available episode if you're taking your time and playing carefully, and I never saw any crashes or game-breaking bugs during that time. Looking forward to the next episode releases.",1
137874292,1512050,"This is not the usual games I play and before I knew it 70 minutes had passed. I really enjoy the World Turtle Idea, I was a fan of that concept ever since I first heard of Disc World. Now this game isn't related to Disc World but it is borrowing the World Turtle Concept which I find very fun.  The game play is very calming in the sense you construct buildings in locations and then the Meeps (NPC's) do all the work. You tell them what to focus on and away they go. Enjoying the Hexagonal grid I think this was a great choice.  As the games in early access I have a few suggestions. 1) It would be nice if the ground had some more detail like grass blowing in the wind just to add something more. 2) When zooming into the Meep the camera rotation is a little jumpy this could be smoothed out. 3) I'm not sure if I missed it but it would be nice to rotate the camera so you can see the Turtle underside and face etc (Maybe I didn't do the rotations right)  Overall so far an entertaining game, looking forward to the Campaign.",1

The gun play feels abysmal, stats on guns that have no measurements in game to show what changes and feel like they change nothing anyway. Ai is broken unable to spamn correctly half the time either in walls or ""invincible"". Ai shoot threw walls negating as attempts at cover. ( I played the sheild girl would get in a choke point only to get shot threw the walls around me ) Legit everything in the game cant hit you if you wall back and a little to the left or stand on a small box or car, they cant pathfind ect. The so called stealth character marking crow will agro ai negating his entire play style.  The 90% of the tech trees for characters are health or ammo which neither is needed as there is a over abundance of ammo. And hp is eh since u get more but the packs only heal like 90hp so more health is a detriment. You can cross the entire map and not see a single enemy.

137874377,1669000,"A great entry into the Age of Wonders series. Tons of customization for nearly endless replay options, an attractive presentation and reasonable AI. Great game!",1
137874353,1669000,Yes,1
137874235,1669000,Honestly one of the best 4X games since Civ 5!,1
137874187,1669000,"I have no prior experience with the series. I took a chance on this one because the screenshots looked neat. I'm glad I did.   4X games can often be [i]a little much.[/i] Genuinely impressed by how quickly and eloquently AoW4 on-boarded my dumb ass. The tooltip system here isn't [i]new[/i] but I rarely see it implemented so well. There's a lot of sauce with which to get lost in, but I never did, and that's maybe the most impressive thing about it.  As well as just randomly generated maps for you to do your wizard king thing over, there are more hand-tailored, smaller maps that have narrative hooks built in that act as a kind of semi-tutorial. It's hand-holding, but only if, how, and when you want it. Otherwise, go buck-wild. Lead your hog-riding molemen into a savage war with the undead frog people to stop them from blanketing the entire world in a shadowy miasma and twisting all life into un-life. Or whatever, you do you.  Make no mistake, the quantity can only exist because of the framework. Yes, every society will have a granary and a library, but sometimes the low level gold-generating building is a mint, or sometimes it's a torture dungeon. Functionally, exactly the same, but very flavourful. I think past the supremely well put together base mechanics of this 4X Turn Based Strategy Game, the [i]flavour[/i] of AoW4 is really special.  My favourite thing about these kinds of games is the story that forms around you, around the game. Civ doesn't really have this, and it's for that reason that, I hate to say it, I may never play Civ again. There is a certain sameness present in the game owing to how much is actually just [i]the same but different[/i], but if you're not the kind of lunatic who puts 900 of your next 1,000 hours exclusively into a single video game, you shouldn't lose that flavour. You create the character that leads the people you created on a path that you lay out. You decide how to deal with the problems that come up, and while that is often ""Good/Evil/Not today thanks"" or ""I want the outcome what gives me Money/Science/Military/Etc"" it's always couched in something flavourful that becomes a part of, or even informs the direction of, that specific story for that specific game. It's very role-play-able, and I think that's what makes games like these exciting and fun, outside of the still very present, but cold ""one more turn"" nature of these game.  I found myself frustrated with how rote and bland so many games of Civ ended up being. I was massively overwhelmed with just how much [i]stuff[/i] there is to keep track of in more grand strategy games. Age of Wonders 4 is, for me, [b]Juuust Right.[/b]",1
137873767,1669000,"Hell yes, AoW4 is a blast to play! It also was released in a nowadays rare quality with a very polished state. Regardless of some players having technical issues, I did not experience a single crash or major bug so far, which nowadays is unheard of.  TLDR:  +amazing customization options +quite deep game mechanics +great replay value if you like the 4x genre +various win conditions and map modifiers +looks great +runs great +humble meta progressions system -(obviously) takes some time getting into -apperently a few desync issues in multiplayer",1

Yes, but they're being tweaked.  Is the game fun in spite of any of the nitpicking things you can find wrong with it?  Hell to the yes.  It's beyond evident that these devs care about their game and will continue to polish it throughout early access.  By the time this game is finished it's going to be a game I'll continue to come back to.  What I'd like to see:  an alternate campaign mode where you can choose the specific superstar you want as your teammate along with the specific talent you want to start Angus off with.  Also, I wouldn't mind being able to pick a different character as your main character (i.e. not Angus).  I don't need an additional story for this alternate campaign, it's more about just being able to play a campaign with different flavoring.  I wouldn't lose any sleep over this never being implemented, however.",1
137872177,1566200,Loving the game. Not without it's flaws. Friendly AI can get confused and stuck around own net. Skating sometimes feels like being a drunk duck on ice. But all frustrations can be released by throwing your stick at a refs face.   Looking forward to what the game will become.,1

137874152,1494420,"Awesome game, very interesting mechanics. Granted it's in early access, but I feel it can do with some kind of troop transport vehicle, flying vehicles, drones of some kind. That would be pretty cool. More base defences like towers and sandbag walls or something.   Overall I think the game has a lot of potential A good cross between killing bugs like Starship troopers, Arma game play but with jumping, RTS like C&C, Environment like Dune. Was very pleased and happy for an early access game.   Noticeable awesomeness was the way vehicles move across the dunes, how the suspension looks fine tuned, you can tell a lot of effort went into that. And the way the bugs can climb vertical surfaces as expected from bugs, that caught me off guard! very awesome. Can imagine would be awesome ambushes from the scorpions.   Admittedly I've only played <2 hours in EA, but will be purchasing again once friends purchase the game and after my wedding!   Intimidate things to improve on in my opinion: - AI pathing, especially for harvesters tend to go back and forth like Austin Powers on a kart in a hallway.  - Enemy AI base building and pathing (Bugs built a whole base on the surface of a 2p coin.)  Bravo Bohemia - Heading back to Arma III - Out",1
137873713,1494420,I'll keep this simple. The idea is great. Games have tried to do it before. But this game is simply just not ready enough to purchase.

There are ore piles on the map that you need to break for permanent upgrades, there are 25 mines you need to clear to win(you chose 1 out of 3 upgrades).

A few games don't work to my knowledge, like the one similar to space invaders but most are completely fine.

I know the team has recently made a change to make unlocks a little easier -- I'm not sure that was necessary since you could easily get an unlock per run if you beat Act 1 each time.  AI is actually pretty decent, with the exception that if you're ahead you can simply hold the puck behind your own net and they won't know what to do.

137876022,2390140,"FINALLY!  I’m an early Kickstarter backer and I can honestly say this has been one of my most anticipated P&C games of 2020… and 2021.. and 2022…  But in all seriousness this game has the potential to be a fresh of fresh air in the adventure game genre. The inventory system feels unique but also completely intuitive if you’re familiar with classic point and click games. The dialogue system is also pretty innovative, it doesn’t feel like a chore but actually useful to progress.  And the atmosphere is really heavy and cinematic. It reminds me of classic LucasArts games like Full Throttle of The Dig.  PROS  • Voice acting is AMAZING.  • Art is GORGEOUS • The puzzles all made sense  • I don’t know what’s going on with the story yet, but I can’t wait to find out!  CONS  • I had to stop myself from playing after 15 mins because I don’t want to spoil the story too much • Not really a con, but if the devs could hurry up and finish the full game that’d be GREAT :)",1
137875702,1340920,"Once you understand the rules, it's rather simple, but this is still an enjoyable puzzle game that continues adding new mechanics.  You play the part of a pig with the unusual name of Oink 3. He resolves to discover a new purpose in life after seeing a light from the sky one evening that seemed to do nothing.   The path you follow is strictly linear. While there may occasionally be a hidden fork in the path that leads to a secret, you still need to proceed in the direction that the natural flow of game directs you, which requires that you complete puzzles. Unfortunately, parts of the map are not unique and the only indication that you are working on a different set of puzzles are the numbers (1-2, 4-2, etc.).  The goal is always the same, even though puzzles combine a few different mechanics. You need to make your way to the piece by using axes to cut down trees, bombs to blow up rocks and planks to create a bridge over the water.   Another significant element that takes center stage in the second part of the game are the chess pieces. However, you only need to know the most basic rules of chess, which are even shown on the screen. Most of the time they are just regular objects that may be moved around.   As a matter of fact, each new set of puzzles introduces a new mechanic. The only one I didn’t like was thunderstrike that destroys floors and forces you to move quick. Fortunately, it takes place only in a couple of puzzles.   The difficulty emerges from the lack of a ""undo"" button. Every puzzle has a very precise solution, so it's very easy to waste a resource on an object that will cause you to become stuck. When you have multiple pigs under your control at once that share resources, things get much tougher. Making one wrong move so close to the solution happens a lot. Surprisingly, later puzzles do away with this idea and are typically much simpler.  Occasional characters you encounter on the map add some flavor to the world and open the path forward. They can be easily ignored because they don’t do anything else other than joke around. There’s also a bus stop that lets you travel between parts of the map. This seems a little pointless because the map is not very big.",1

137877040,1375900,"Overall, the core gameplay is great and it definitely brings something new to the table in an already oversaturated genre. Now, all it really needs is more variety. With the current set of 6 weapons and 4 passives, all of which have an upgrade path of ~5 different upgrades you can choose 3 from each, it doesn't last long till you find more or less what works and what doesn't, at which point it mostly becomes an achievement grind. The only two characters available do differ in their primary weapon, but even those are simply 2 of the weapons you can also normally get in-game and therefore don't play particularly different to each other once you get more weapons. And in terms of enemy variety, it only offers about 4 different normal mobs with 1 boss, which spawns twice throughout the run.  It's an early access title and based on their roadmap, I trust they'll add more content over time. So if you enjoy revisiting games whenever there's a new update and don't mind not having all that much to do right away, I'd recommend it.",1

But overall this is great.  A free game with a online mode, though it just launched so you probably cant find many lobby's at the moment but I would recommend to try this game. I thank the devs from Besto Game Team for making a game out of love for Hololive and giving it to us for free and I do hope they keep the game free while adding new character and stages. If needed I would suggest to make a donation page and not to add paid dlc but the decisions are for the devs to make.   Either way this is a great game and I hope the devs make more like and get support from players. Hopefully the online playerbase gonna grow for this one as this is free. Though you can play with your friends locally or by creating a server so this is great, thank you.",1

137880693,2086140,I have already seen enough! This game is beyond bad in multiple aspects. - The performance is so terrible when you try turning bloom/shader effects on or even at higher settings  - it will melt your GPU while still looking very simple XDDDDD.  - Upgrades are unrecognizeable and some do the same and just have a different name (means you have to read through every upgrade on every level up and do that probably for the whole run and beyond). - Hit feedback when receiving damage is basicaly non-exsistent. Occacionaly you look over to your healthbar to the right border of your screen and be like - oh when did my health get soo low and how??!!.  2 Bucks is not much money asked and there is content but its NOT worth your time at version 20 right now! It has potential but also a loong way ahead of itself and i doubt it will ever reach its full potential because fundamentaly (technicaly) this game is not good. Good luck.,0
137881266,2246110,"At several moments, this game will have you questioning whether you need to change your approach or if you're just unlucky that a few misdrawn pixels screwed you over. The other times, it will just leave you stumped.",1

And all that with such a pricetag is just insulting to the player. And im not going to start on all the bugs, absolute stupid gameplay mechanics, the situation that you need an active internet connection for a single player game. I gave the game 3 hours. Thats time i will never get back in my life.  Just dont buy this mess of a game. There are definetly better options for you to spend ypur money on.",0
137878506,1155330,"I am a huge fan of turn-based tactical games and am always on the lookout for more titles of this kind, and Showgunners definitely scratched that itch. The game's closer to Chimera Squad than X-Com proper - the cast of characters is small with each one having specific weapon type and unique abilities, combat encounteres are fast but numerous, there is no strategic meta-game on top, instead in between fights you do some light exploration and encounter some environmental puzzles. While surviving the fights on its own usually isn't too difficult, many arenas provide some optional objectives or complications that make things more challenging and interesting. I honestly think that thanks to being so straightforward, Showgunners may be a good introduction to the genre for someone who didn't play turn-based tactical games before. And to top it off, soundtrack is absolutely on point.",1
137881705,1669000,"The game is fun. love the fact you can customize your ruler and have them as a hero that evolves alongside your people. the combat is fun and has a satisfying tactical element to it. the campaign side is also not as much of a drag as other 4x games that implement similar mechanics. like grievances from humankind as an example.  That being said. the naval combat is bare bones. The multiplayer is very slow as no one can do anything on the campaign map as long as someone is in combat. this is a huge problem in the middle to late game when fights are bigger and take longer. if these things get fixed, then it would be one of the best 4x games of all time in my opinion.",1
137881680,1669000,great game,1
137881642,1669000,"I finally decided to take the plunge because I've always been interested in strategy/tactical/4X games but mainly because I'm done with the modern-day gaming industry; specifically the triple AAA industry. I've had it with microtransactions being pushed down my throat and content being locked behind a pay wall that should just be in the base game from the start.   Over the last few years, my passion for gaming was dying because I thought it was due to me growing up and responsibilities being the main focus in my life now. Every game I tried from the big developers are either broken on release, filled with microtransactions, or a boring and repetitive gameplay experience rehashed in a next gen game (I'm looking at you Ubisoft). I really wanted to rekindle my love for gaming again and I struck gold with AoW 4!  Super satisfied with this game! It's my first 4X experience and it's definitely overwhelming for me. However, I've never had so much fun playing a game again. I love the fantasy setting, the xcom-style combat is engaging, and micro-managing my cities & armies is something I thought would be tedious at first but is actually an enjoyable gameplay loop. Can't wait to sink more hours into this game and get lost in the lore and universe.",1
137881596,1669000,4X perfection,1
137881499,1669000,"The game is amazing! My new favorite game. Graphics, sound, music, gameplay is all good. There is also really good customization. It's basically a mixture between Heroes of Might and Magic, Civilization, Endles Legend and Total War Warhammer. The gameplay loop is really addictive. I love the unit and empire customization, it might be one of the best. The art design is also very very good, with a lot of attention to detail. This is also the base game. If the base game is so good, I can't imagine how it's gonna be after 5 expansions. Don't mess this up devs, you have a real gem here. Top recommend from me as a strategy and tactical game lover. Cheers!",1
137880649,1669000,"Although I'm not recomending the game it's not because the game is bad. Surely there are some performance issues (it won't slow down the gaem but will cause audio distortions) it will probably be patched soon (tm) and some people were having issues with crashes and not being able to play. I had a few crashes too but that will probably be fixed soon too.  The reason why I don't recomend is because while the game has a few good systems, it has some very questionable decisions that actively hinder the game significantly. Things like not being able to remove the underground which is a hinder because it doesn't respects relative player distances and therefore very often causes enemies to spawn right next to the player. Things like not being able to chose the hero limit. Things like not being able to remove the cap of how many cities you can have (this is a hinder if you play domination mode as your only choice is to raise almost every town you come across).  The whole game is riddled with some good sterps forward and some steps back too. It's not that the game can't be enjoyed, but as it stands right now it's very hard to recomend until several game start customisation features are added and some balance passes are done, especially considering the price point is 50 Euros which is 10 more than AoW3 was released at (but the same as planetfall).",0
137879832,1669000,"A really fun game that blends together many successful elements from other games and truly allows you to live out whatever 4X strategy desire you want. It also is fully ready to play on launch day, and is worth the full price which is already reduced from a normal full priced game. Overall huge fan, adn I am really enjoying playing this game",1

137881222,1566200,"This game isn't hard.  It is cheap and makes you feel like the enemy AI is cheating and your friendly AI being next to useless it make it hard to recommend this game to anyone.  They have a good concept but has very lazy game design. With for now, a very short campaign and boss teams using similar gimmicks the amount of enjoyment you will receive will be limited.",0
137880942,1566200,"A GREAT HOCKEY GAME! It isn't a simulation like EA NHL, but it's a load of fun and satisfies the itch. We've been waiting for a good hockey game on PC since the leafs last won the cup in 1967.  Fun little roguelike story, playable with friends, through multiple difficulties. Play against your friends in play now, just like the good ol days.   Only local co-op for now (split screen/remote play) - hoping for multiplayer in the future. Slap in some multiplayer PVP options, and we have a new king of hockey.  Recommendations?  Turning off ""Powers"" in Play Now should even out the stats of the team, to make it feel like 'regular hockey'.  Add multiplayer options: Play now against friends, or queue up and play against other players with your friends.",1
137879185,1566200,"Ice Hockey with roguelite elements is a combo I never expected, but here we are. Quirky power ups, art-style and humour in the vein of Castle Crashers, makes for a fun combination. A lot of potential, but needs a little work. I would personally like to see customisation added for our personal team. Being able to change the logo, name and kit colours would go a long way to personalising the experience. Also maybe some editing of our character and benchwarmers.   Also, Arthur's super power slapshot is broken. Please nerf it.",1
137881439,1494420,The game has incredible potential to become an amazing game. I think the game is fun for a while but needs some additives and maybe some tweaks and adjustments. I suggest buying the game and trying it out for a bit and letting this one bake in the oven.,1
137880866,1494420,"Cool concept, wish they released the game when it was finished though. As long as they keep working on it, I can recommend this. Current state feels like a demo, but it is pretty awesome having the option to fight alongside your troops on an RTS game scale, though they really need to add a way to command troops while you're on foot so you can have them follow you and give orders, but maybe they already have that planned. Would've liked to see a grand strategy type of thing where you capture/manage territory on the map and fight the battles on the ground or at least some sort of way to have a continuous game, but from what I've seen, it's mostly going to be RTS/Skirmish rounds against the opponent and the match is over, which is reasonable, but can get somewhat repetitive in my opinion.  Overall seems like a lot of potential, just gotta see what direction they take the game in.",1
137879408,1494420,"Despite being very EA it's actually serviceable. Multiplayer fixes most of the large issues the game has (primarily bad AI). Somehow the first person mode paired with the physics, graphics and scale honestly puts this game higher for me in some ways than a lot of AAA titles. The strategy portion is pretty undercooked right now but I'm very excited to see where this game goes over the years. Has the potential to be the best RTS/FPS hybrid ever made.",1
137880104,2337630,"Even with all the bugs, glitches, inconsistencies and problems it is still a major upgrade from previous titles and given a couple of weeks for the devs to iron out the bugs and add a few more features and we'll have a good game on our hand.",1
137879149,2337630,"Of all the broken games, this is the most broken. God dam it is bad. I have tried to play 6 matches, I have finished one. How they can justify charging 100 dollars for something that simply does not work is beyond comprehension...",0

137879834,2211730,"Ah, yes. I'm hooked. This is the typical game that triggers an addiction. Killbug follows a recent trend that the notorious game Devil Daggers has brought into the FPS world: endless enemy waves thrown into a very small arena that can't be truly defeated, the real goal is to survive as long as possible to beat our own high score and climb the global leaderboard. I have played several Devil Daggers clones so far (besides the original game itself of course), some well made, some not. But I am very happy to say that Killbug is the very best in my opinion. This game stands out for two very smart additions to the traditional formula: an acrobatic and more vertical movement system, and the overall ""clarity"" of the game world. Everything in this game is absolutely CLEAN. All enemies (besides being all very colorful and nice-looking) are perfectly visible on the background, the movement system is flawless and ultra-responsive, the UI is simple and practical, and even the damage notifications are clearly conveyed to the player. If you are good and focused, you can have perfect control over the whole game arena. This game is extremely simple, it does one single thing, but it does it in the best way possible, without a single hiccup. Briefly, it's the kind of game that I simply love! No useless additions, no sterile complications, just pure gameplay and extreme fun, all at a very very high pace. Furthermore, the devs even cared to add a bit of lore to the game, very smart in my opinion, thus providing that little additional flavor that makes this little gem even more shining and precious. Absolutely recommended if you are not afraid of challenging games. Cheers guys!",1

137878477,1582600,"Knew about this game since its from an Indian dev and I wanted to support them. Overall, I recommend the prologue since it does have some really great art and goes for the Stardew Valley/Animal Crossing type life sim gameplay set in a Rural Indian Village setting. The commitment to that is evident from the variety of plants which are native as well as capturing the art style which has a traditional Indian flair.   Now on to some issues I had with the gameplay which I think could be improved upon.  -Gathering feels a bit unsatisfying and considering that's a major chunk of the game I'd probably prefer a diff sound than the pop that's used quite a bit. -There's no prices given before you sell something so you can of have to trial and error it. -There was a bug making lime tea in my game where the ingredients would show as used but no tea was produced. -I had a few issues with the Tea Time segment of gameplay, mainly when it came to knowing whether a customer would like to order. You just have to keep spamming till you get an order from them. There's also no end to Tea Time till you end it, since the tea and firewood around you regenerates you could basically grind your way to having a ton of cash. There's no button to cancel while cooking you just have to exit out the window so that can be kind of a hassle.  -I think that the painting portion of gameplay could be improved a bit, I love exploring around to get inspiration but maybe there could be more involvement from the player like allowing us to colour in some of it like paint-by-numbers.  Ultimately, I'm very excited to play the full game and see where the devs take this.",1

137881880,2311190,"I bought two copies of this game and played through it with my 5-year-old son. I completed some of the puzzles twice and almost went mental but he had a blast. Sure there's questionable gameplay, a bit of copy paste and the voice acting is pure cringe, however from a little kid's perspective it was a pretty exciting game. There's 1-2 hours of content (you can double that if you're as crazy as me) and the overall quality is consistent with chapter 2, which makes the money well spent for a fan.

137882226,1742020,"The game is good but please add Pekora! Today is officially day 2 of my attempt at a multi-day stim binge for the purposes of giving myself hallucinations of Pekora. I have saved 800mg of Adderall from the last three months, and will be reupping constantly over the next several dozen hours because my body hates me and builds tolerance like a motherfcker. I also stopped taking my anti-psychotics and mood stabilizers 4 days ago. The constant dopamine rush from the Adderall and forcing myself to watch Non-Stop archives of Pekora while alternating occasionally with archives of her roommate are sustaining my mania. I have started to see shadows moving in my peripheral vision, but more importantly, I heard her laugh in the distance today while making breakfast (which i realized after making i couldn't eat because fcking Adderall) despite having restarted my computer and my phone being off. I intend to now keep a low volume looped video of her laugh on in the background for all of her archives to try and exacerbate this going forward. Redoing 30mg in 2 hours from this post. I feel good; I think I'm gonna make it bro. Even if it's just for a second, if I can reach a state where I feel like I'm with her, even for a day, even an hour, and spend that time with the person I love most in the world, this will mean the world to me. I try to force myself through every archive, even if I get strong urges to pause or look away, to try and train my brain to accept that this is what it must see whether it wants to or not.",1

137884144,1294810,"I was very skeptical about purchasing this game after reading all the negative reviews but I have been waiting to play this for several months so decided to risk it.  After playing through several hours and missions, I have to admit that I'm not sure where all the hate is coming from.  Here is my experience based on the current PC version:  1.) Difficulty- I mostly play RPG and survival games with the occasional FPS.  I found this game to be plenty challenging and have died numerous times to various situations.  Weeping Tammy was a major pain and killed me so many times I lost count. Maybe as I reach higher levels it becomes easier due to better gear but right now it is plenty difficult.  2.) Open world- A lot of people criticizes how empty the world feels.  I have two thoughts on this. First, the setting reminds me of the movie The Purge.  Whatever is plaguing Redfall has been going on for at least weeks if not months from what I can tell.  With cultist and vampires killing people indiscriminately during that time, I would expect the town to be largely vacant (what normal person would stick around and carry on their daily routine).  For me, this plays into the atmosphere of the story and I found it to add a creepy vibe. Second, that said, I still easily found enemies to fight when I wanted too.  I'm not sure how the developer could add a lot more without the town becoming over crowded.  I don't think it would make sense to flood the streets with enemies like, for example, Dying Light.  I personally enjoyed the opportunity to explore houses for notes and equipment without constantly being attacked.  3.) Performance- I average between 50 and 60 fps for most of the game with the occasional unexplained dipped into the teens.  I have not been disconnected at all since I started playing.  I haven't really noticed any major bugs either yet.  I would agree that the aiming for weapons feels a little off but you get use to it after playing. Enemy AI isn't the most sophisticated but it isn't the worst either.  I would say its about average. Can you exploit some of the enemies if you really wanted too? Sure, but that's a choice your can make or not and I have found it to be largely situational anyway.   Maybe the biggest mistake was marketing this as an action shooter in a vampire setting when it probably should have been presented more as a horror exploration game with FPS elements.  I do agree that $70 dollars is steep but I feel that way about any video game (unfortunately I think this is going to be the new norm for price).  Overall, I would encourage people to give it a try on PC.  I cant speak to console.",1

137885428,1494420,"so as of writing this review with at least 9 hours of gameplay, and while the game is in its early access stage, I have come to the following conclusion  tldr: great game with good potential, however its still missing some key components  Pros:  The feeling of commander and infantry: both parts of the same team have very different feelings and playstyle, working together is a key part of the game. being the commander in its RTS mode is a wonderful feeling (as long as the AI does not bug out) and you feel the weight of responsability as you try to command the army, and as someone playing as infantry, you bear the weight of not breaking the expensive toy the commander gave you, and you have to make as much use with what you have  faction differences: humans and aliens have very different playstyles, humans have very heavy weaponry to wipe the whole map clean, while aliens are fast and swarm in numbers, with the added bonus that they can climb cliffs to create ambushes.  looks: while the commander may not have the graphics on the highest, as a fps player the game looks amazing, seeing the rockets and tanks fire at the night as the swarms of aliens are lit up by the fire as they continue their charge is a sight to be hold, even if the railgun tanks do cause some frame drops when there is a cluster of them.  sound: hearing the sounds of the massive vehicles and the aliens charge is incredible, while there are some areas to be worked on, its really good so far  price: keep in mind £17.95, a split will go to steam, and a split to the publisher, so the solo developer wont be getting the full amount, if anything with how many people have got the game, I would argue it may have just covered the cost of making it, seeing what is to come for the future, I would gladly pay more for this  passion: this is a solo developer project, you can see the passion, yes there are some janky things that need fixing, but in the first 2 days the developer rolled out an update to help with fixes, this is a massive passion project, which not many games can show easily  Cons:  ai: the ai is quite buggy, a alien player controlling a hunter is strong, as a ai its as weak as a crab sometimes. the harvesters get stuck a lot, and the alien shrimp (harvesters) dont like collecting the stuff near them and take long unnecesary routes. with some fixes and improvements they could play really well  server stability: there are times when the game starts a new, I will be in for a few minuets but later kicked out and disconected  no way to kick/ban: recently there have been encounters of players joining and taking strong vehicals/aliens and destroying their own bases, before switching to the other team to do the same, as it stands there is no way to kick a player or ban them, only to host a private game which will make the community closed off  no in game voice: having to type in chat to relay anything to the commander or to your fellow team takes time which can make or break a defence/siege on a location, having a radio system would be really beneficial  text chat: at the moment while it is being fixed, the text chat sometimes breaks mid session, only displaying the most recent message, which in a full server can get chaotic  player actions that commander cant do: with aliens, they can burrow if a player takes control, but the commander cant seem to place that order onto a alien, it would really help out with their ambush tactics  conclusion:  while there are things that need fixing before this can be a truly amazing game for a lot of people, it is worth the price I would say, and I am really looking forward to how this game updates in the future, (cant wait for the aircraft update)",1
137884816,1494420,"Half an hour was all it took with this one. This game definitely had that, ""I better get through this before my 2 hours is up"" vibe to it and I'm glad I was smart and saved that $20 for hopefully something better in the future.  My initial experience (and only experience) with Silica was so intensely underwhelming that refunding it immediately after the round was over was a decision which required no consideration whatsoever. No game should ever feel like that the first time you play it. I am not going to get into all the reasons why, go read one of the longer thumbs down reviews if you want more info. Everything they are saying is true. I tried to give Silica the benefit of the doubt, but it didn't work out. No big loss.",0
137884392,1494420,"As of this moment not recommended but once the pathfinding gets iron'd out there's a lot of good here.  Only played commander and I intend to keep playing later, but after three games and ZERO TUTORIAL (my man there needs to at least be a written guide or something) I can say without a doubt that the aliens are the best faction. Not because of superior damage or unit cost or any real numbers. It's the fact that the human harvester vehicles are so goddamn unwieldy, slow, and unable to pathfind. The human economy is completely stopped by a harvester getting stuck and until a player gets in it or tries to fix it, the AI cannot get itself unstuck. The damn AI has no reverse gear. So once that gets fixed I'll play more but holy crap my harvesters got stuck both of my human games but I stomped in my alien game because I didn't have to worry about that crap. Fix the human harvesters.",0

Have fun Crapping your pants.",1
137882940,1667180,"I have a few hours under my belt playing the game and I have to say it isn't a bad game. Does it need some work? Yes. Overall though, it is playable and has some interesting aspects.   For example, you are not just given knowledge of everything to craft immediately. You have to get out and explore and find blueprints to learn things like the alchemy table. This requires you to go explore, fight, and gain experience.   The combat is OK. I tried range and melee so far. Range is good, but if you run out of ammo, your char runs right up to the mob and starts punching it! So make sure you have ammo to go hunting!  One area that could use improvement is the swapping of weapons/tools. I found I had to leave my char window open and manually swap items in and out as needed. This becomes troublesome in a fight where you go from ranged to melee. It also reduces screen view to leave the window open. Maybe I am missing something, so this could be resolved I just don't know it. :)   You'll also want to make a bag as soon as you can. Your beginning inventory is your hot bar. Once it is full, you cannot pickup anything more. Since there is a lot to pickup in the beginning, you will want to focus on what you need to make a ""base"" and staying alive.   All-in-all, I like the game. I have found nothing so far that is game breaking as far as glitches or bugs. I recommend picking it up and giving it a go.",1
137882379,2397400,"To be perfectly honest, it ends up feeling like half a story rather than a complete story arc. It would have been more engaging if it wasn't broken into a part 1 and a to be continued part 2.",0
137884904,1849360,"SGS Lands Another Hit!  I have slowly been getting into SGS games lately because they often look at ""forgotten wars"" or smaller conflicts and they really do a good job of representing the time period and sparks my interest to read further into these histories. SGS Nato's Nightmare is a Cold War gone hot game and focuses on a what-if scenario in which the Warsaw Pact invades NATO territory in Germany/Northern Europe.  First, and most importantly, this is a BIG game. The ""advanced"" scenario includes hundreds of counters and you will be moving units on a small scale (think individual ATGM units). This can be overwhelming for some players but if you are into the idea of complete control of NATO or Warsaw Pact forces during this war then it will definitely appeal to you (think War in the East level complexity). Thankfully they have a basic campaign as well which has less counters and operates on a mostly division level scale. I found the basic play to be my favorite as it is less of a time and brain power commitment but it is still fun and you don't lose any of the ""big war"" feel by doing it this way.  My favorite part of the game is its faithfulness to actual unit types and capabilities as well as the absolutely BEAUTIFUL map and unit cards. The person who does the art work for SGS games nails it every time it seems, and this game is no exception.   Another great thing that I always look for in war games is the inclusion of events or historical pop-ups that add a bit of life to the war you are fighting and this game has a TON of it. I think it's pretty awesome and informational, and there are things going on all over the world that affect the war you are fighting. The game does a great job of relaying these to the player.  There are only a few cons I'd like to mention about this game but none of them are game breaking: -Slowdown during certain portions of the game such as during the card draw phase. This isn't a big deal but more of a pain in the rear just because you are trying to choose cards from your ""hand"" and the slowdown impedes that. Probably a limitation of the engine, but I think the devs are working on it. -Popups appear for both the player and the AI and are the same (I think?) every turn. That means that the flavor text, tips, and rules popups are seen twice by the player every turn. I'd much rather have this seen only once but it isn't a big deal, you just click through them.  Other than that I'd say this is an AWESOME war game set during the Cold War and the developers' passion and technical prowess shines through every minute that you play it. Games like this are the reason I am a ""war gamer"", it's awesome to see developers work to their strengths and be passionate about their product and you can see it when you play.  Ending pro-tip: If you are new to SGS games and want to get into it but find something like this a bit too daunting then try another one of their games but in a smaller and older setting. My suggestion is SGS Halls of Montezuma, which allows you to fight the Mexican-American War. The games all have the same mechanics but learning the game with only the use of muskets, cavalry, artillery, and limited navy will teach you how to play. Then you can work your way up to satellites, supersonic aircraft, and nuclear weapons!",1

However, some reviewers have noted that the texture can be a bit gritty and that it can be challenging to mix the powder thoroughly.  In conclusion, if you are looking for a plant-based protein powder that is organic, vegan, and free from artificial ingredients, Garden of Life RAW Organic Protein Plant-Based Protein Powder, Bananas & Cream may be worth considering. However, as with any supplement, it is always a good idea to speak with a healthcare professional before adding it to your diet.  on a side note pls dont censor spider sec scene next time i was really intrigued but let down so fast, and why am i now a father of the stupid little orphan small pink bird",0

137885168,2370640,"Pros:  potato Love the ""nodding"" feature that reinforces the controls. Love the ending. Dig the score.  Critique/areas for improvement:  Would really like gamepad UI because this is the type of gameplay I'd prefer to use a controller for. Cameras have always been a tough thing to dial in for 3D platformer games. I will say that a little smoothing would go a long way to reduce both the jitter that is fatiguing to watch and the unexpected camera movements that negatively affect gameplay. Close quarters camera is rough but I don't have a recommended fix for that - it's an issue most 3D platformers have. See if you can put a logo png to replace the unity logo in the taskbar. Fire sound effects in the first level are not positional, meaning they sound like they're coming from the center of the screen rather than the fire (especially noticeable when you turn the camera). Could also attenuate fire audio so it's quieter as the potato is further away. There seemed to be a lack of a ""rolling"" sound. If it were me, I would accomplish this by playing/looping an audio file when the potato is on a surface and changing both the volume and the pitch (slightly) based on velocity. The jump sound effect wasn't bad, but it didn't feel 100% right to me and it sounded like multiple jumps at once. I recommend going for something more subtle and clearly defined. Thunder sounds in the credits are noticeably repetitive. I recommend a longer loop or chopping it up and randomizing it (the latter being more difficult to implement) Soaked potato sounds so squishy/splattery that was uncomfortable for me to listen to for extended periods of time and beyond suspension of disbelief. Achievement icons are noticeably low-res in the codex. Steam achievement integration would be nice.  ""How are you holding up? Because I’m a potato."" - GlaDOS",1

137885300,1742020,"Amazing. Can't argue with the price what so ever, it's free. But I would honestly pay $10 if not more for it. The gameplay feels like Melty Blood Type Lumina mixed with DNF duel and a hint of Street Fighter.  The people behind this game, you can tell, they are competent, and seem to have come a long way from the start of the development and I was quite suprised that they produced so much quality while not losing focus on what the game was going to be. And it's still free. You can see a lot of love and care was put in, while also making it accessible to non-fighting game players.  Although, the game currently on launch did come out with a lot of bugs and possibly even exploits I have yet to see, I am completely contempt and frankly over it, as I expect the game would likely get better and better if the developers give the same amount of care in the future as they did for the game before. Even with bugs, if you look beyond it, you can see that this is a genuine fighting game with existing and interesting mechanics.  Thank you very much, Team Besto Games.",1

A few nitpicking things the bosses don't have any mechanics that are a must dodge which makes them have almost no threat once you start getting higher in your upgrades you can just stand and trade blows. The blows don't feel like they have a lot of impact on some of the enemies mainly the mushrooms and wolves so before you upgrade it feels like you're forced to trade blows and don't have much outplay until you one-shot them. The platforming feels a bit floaty which takes some getting used to, but definitely not the worst I've seen. Overall definitely worth checking out.",1

137889237,1550010,"Ok, where to start. First of all, I realize this is early access. Having said that, it is a good little game so far. However,  there are a few things that are turning me off at this point. I have played quite a few hours and what really bugs me is it takes way to long to make money in this game, which means, it gets frustrating.   There is a quest board where you can take quests to earn money, but, the quests are generally, mostly off season quests. So, a quest might tell me to go get a certain flower or mushroom and its not even available in the season I am in. Other quests don't really have enough instructions for me to know where to go or where to look for certain items.    So, the quest board is one issue. They need more quests fitting the seasons you are in, and more instructions or hints where to find things, to make it easier to earn cash at the start. I feel stagnant and like I cannot progress quickly enough to keep me interested. And I don't like that.  The other thing is I wish they would make days longer. If I want to travel any far distance on the map, by the time I run there and do a bit of foraging I have to  head right back home because its getting late. so, this also is frustrating because once again, like the quest board issue, I am finding it frustrate to progress or get anything done because the day is too short.   it just feels like an endless loop of running, teleporting back home, sleeping and getting almost nothing done for days. Its taking forrrrrrrrrrrrrever to get anywhere!!!!!!!  I also lost my axe for some unknown reason at the start of the game and needed 1000 bucks to buy it back. Well, since the quest boards were mostly useless or the quests I could do offered little money, i had no way to re buy the axe. Therefore I could not chop wood to make cash. It really limited me. The only way I managed to get money was when i found a way, after a long time, to fix my stall in front of my house so I could sell things. Even that was sort of slow going though.  they also need to fix the lack of inventory space, give us more inventory slots or bigger chests. I hate having a million chests all over my house.  And please add a little more instructional hand holding when it comes to where to find certain flowers, plants, and so on.   However, I know its early access.   I just hope the devs read this and adjust accordingly, because otherwise this game is really nice, has enjoyable wilderness areas to explore, lots of different types of plant et al, in various seasons. I can see a lot of people liking this type of game if it gets done right in the end. If it is done right it will get word of mouth and good reviews and they could potentially make alot of money with this game!   Plus,there seems to be a lot to the game already but its way to frustrating at this point for me recommend. If you get it on sale for 10 bucks or less try it. Or if you want to support the devs of course. Otherwise, wait and see if they make it better, and if they do, then I would say it would be worth buying at the full 20 bucks.   I do like the game, but right now its....to frustrating. But, but, but, I am going to give it a thumbs up due to early access and because I do like the look and feel of the game. and there is alot to explore and do.",1
137888114,1550010,"Currently unplayable, I hope this will improve with further updates. The worst problem is that the game frequently hangs/crashes, I experienced three flavors: complete unresponsiveness to movement controls but with menu access (you can sometimes just sit this one out), a black screen with mouse pointer but completely unresponsive (including Alt+F4), and an outright program exit. Since you cannot save the game at intervals of your choosing (and in fact the very act of saving sometimes leads to one of the crashes), it currently next to impossible to make any game progress. I am currently writing this after I crashed while trying to complete the same in-game day for the fourth time. Beside the stability issues, the game seems promising, if not quite polished. I did expect a lot of content to be missing (after all, this is early access), but the basics of movement and interacting with items should be working already without being janky.

Yes I understand there are glitches right now that can be fixed with a patch, but I am really enjoying the game.  Personally with the speed of the Vampires, I don't mind if the AI isn't the best.  After you kill a few a lot of them act the same way, which makes it easier to take them down.  I am all for it.  I am playing Jacob who I really like.  Give him the silenced assault rifle with scope and he is good to go.  Kicking butt and taking names.  Now if your one of those people that think the game should be perfect before you spend you hard earned cash, then you may want to wait a bit.  Let them work out the bugs and do clean-up.    I bought Cyberpunk 2077 when it first came out, and that was worse then this.  But they fixed it and it runs great now.

The devs seem like they listen to criticism, as some have complained about the lack of rubber earned, but I got over 100 on my past run on Standard difficulty, enough for several upgrades.

137888264,1566200,"Worst hockey game I have ever played. The devs know that hockey is played on ice right? Why does it feel like they are skating on glue? Why do NPC players have a poke check but we do NOT? Where is the checking? No really? where is the checking? There is no momentum to complete a check. NPCs have a poke check but players do not? add a poke check so players have the ability to, you know, play hockey. Sticks can be used for more than shooting you know? oh, that's right, you can throw them and miss have the time instead. Not helpful at all. It seems like the devs have left out core gameplay mechanics in favour of special powers you can acquire. But this makes the core gameplay worse off than that of older hockey games. Changing to a skating player only to have all his speed reduced is agony. Watching the NPCs get a breakaway every time I lose the puck is agony. Having to grind to gain points to spend on permanent stat boosts is just unimaginative. If you are looking for that good old fashioned hockey experience like NHL '94 do NOT get this game. Save your money, wait for updates maybe? This doesn't play like a hockey game and is something else.",0
137888015,1566200,"This game reminds me of 3 on 3 NHL arcade, and let me tell you, this is probably the first hockey game that's come out since then that has got me hooked. A Lot of the reviews talk about how short the campaign is and yes, the way it is set up now you can breeze through all 3 acts in no time. The length isn't a problem at all, i think it's not short enough that you're disappointed when it's over, but it's also no long enough to where you're asking yourself when am i gonna be done with this. I will say that there will be times were you may be devastated at how far you got just to come up short sometimes. Me personally i love the rouge lite aspect of this game, it makes every run feel unique almost, especially with the random events, in my opinion they can be heavily negative sometimes so i tend to normally go for the rest routes or the challenge games, but every once and a while i'll do an event to keep it fresh. Every boss team is unique, it doesn't feel like they were recycled at all, and their gimmicks are pretty funny. The Zebras as referees, the Cult, and to wrap up your charters story you face the Golfers. i was skeptical of the remote play, due to normally my experiences with it haven't been pleasant (the times i have used it, it's been horribly laggy and almost downright unplayable) but with tape to tape, me and my friend ran into no issues with remote play, and were downright in tears laughing so hard at the mischief that was going on in the game. If you're looking for a serious hockey game i wouldn't recommend this, i would say stick with NHL for the consoles as that's be more of a serious and realistic tone, but if you're looking for an arcade style game where you can just unplug your brain and play without really worrying about how you are gonna do, this will be right up your alley. Kudos to the devs for allowing this game to be early access and i hope they continue to focus on this game because the potential is there for such a fantastic game",1

137886158,1494420,how are people able to run this game ? i have an 8 core AMD cpu and a RTX 2070   the game runs at 30 fps on low,0
137886053,1494420,"The fps and rts sides work pretty well from what i can tell from my short testing  There are few shortcomings however: 1. Fps works well but due your speed it's extremely slow to get from point a to point b causing the game play to become boring walking simulator and the map being desert didn't help the situation. 2. On rts side the harvesters pathfinding had few issues, mainly when it had to turn causing it to crush some of the precious minerals on the process. 3. Enemy commanders ai ain't the best, instead of doing the basic rts stuff like building a too many of the same stuff and sending all their troops to die in a fine line, the ai instead builds 3 buildings and sends their basic troops to roam the map. The biggest raid i've ever had was about 6 bugs from one direction and that's it, the ai wont even call their troops to defend the base allowing an easy victory. 4. The info text and prices for buildings and troops is too small making it hard to read. 5. Idk if i was doing it wrong but it seems that you cannot expand too far from your buildings meaning no tiny outposts far away from main base. 6. as far as have played, there doesn't seem to be transports and no flying units. Flying units i understand since they might be difficult to make in game that's both Fps and Rts but transport would be nice for ground troops.   I'm gonna also mention some positive things: 1. Troop scaling. Its not like in starcraft or other rts games where buildings are smaller and troops look either too big or too small than what they appear in lore, this really helps fps players as well. 2. troops can move between and inside buildings if they fit, it looked nice seeing my infantry move between the silos of refinery instead around it. 3. good music and sound design, sure your troops wont say anything when you select them or give them orders but the gunshots, explosions, machinery sound extremely satisfying and the music fits the theme of the game. 4. Pathfinding. If we don't count the harvester, everything else finds its way where you tell them to go. 5. Design of characters and buildings look really nice. 6. Fps is pretty epic if we ignore the walking simulator part. 7. small details, idk if there are that many but with some buildings you can see the troops being made inside and coming out instead just popping out of nowhere.  I may have missed stuff since i've played a short time and alone. i was originally supposed to try this with a friend but he ended up having some trouble and wasnt able to buy the game and i didn't want to play with randoms so i can only give opinion on singleplayer side of things and i didn't bother testing hotkeys so i cannot give opinion about control groups and so on.   I'm gonna refund the game for now since i don't feel like playing without my friends and i want to give it more time in the oven. I will gladly buy it again once it improves, goes on sale or bunch of my friends start showing interest and buying the game.   Remember that the game is still quite early in development so don't rush the devs with pitchforks at hand. If some of my info is missing stuff or is incorrect feel free to correct me and give your own opinions.",1
137888547,2002220,"Bit of a close one here - but I'm tilting towards ""Yes"" because it's still early access, and the developer is active in the community, which is always a good sign.  Pros - Affordable - Solid ""Bullet Heaven"" mechanically - Enemies have actual mechanics rather than mindlessly charging - The pixel art is solid - The inclusion of an actually ""controlled attack"" (Necromancer Flail) is promising and a good move, even if a bit awkward to get used to.  Neutral - The classes are distinct from each other, and have unique skills (this is a neutral because this also means no 'snowballing' is possible for those that enjoy it) - Currently Meta-progression is class-specific (meaning once you finish a class's metaprogression, not much reason to continue playing that class)  Cons - Attack patterns and RNG mitigation could use some work, as it stands, how good a run is - is determined by how soon RNG gives you certain skills. - The color palette could use some work, feels very brown (less so in second area, but more color/value splashes could improve readability)  Video ""First Impression"" can be seen here (game's not far enough along for a proper ""review"" treatment): https://youtu.be/rhGA0zoULmU",1

That centipede sure looks like a living health pack now. Wait did I just parry something and now I have a special shoot?

You come back having learned (hopefully) and can try better next time.  At max one full run takes maybe 2.5 hours, so very little progress is lost on a game over.  This is a co-operative game, and so unless you really enjoy having to manage AI crewmates, I would highly recommend at least having one friend on hand to play with (local co-op and Steam Remote Play both work if you can't convince a friend to spend money on the game).",1

137889198,1849360,"This is my first time diving into an SGS game, and there's a lot to unpack here.  Personally, there's a rather large amount of things that I wish this game did better or different, but in the end, I'm still having a rather good time with this game, although I was skeptical in the first two hours.  I'm not a big fan of the UI, with the rounded corners and partially shaded symbols everywhere, it looks rather arcade-y, and it doesn't bring across the feeling of a serious strategy combat simulation game. But maybe that's just me. It also seems like that the UI is basically the same for all their games, judging from looking at pictures on the store pages. Would have been nice to have that separated a bit thematically.  The soundtrack is really great, it's honestly one of the major things in this game that carries the 80's feeling of this conflict and helps to create immersion, I just really wish there were more tracks, because the tracks that are in the game start to repeat themselves rather quick, and I'm afraid they might get annoying fast. So more of the same would be really cool, but it's no biggie.  A bigger gripe for me is the lack of mouse-over tool-tips. There are a lot of acronyms, especially on the various cards, where I really wish that I could mouse over them and get a detailed explanation of what they mean and affect. The game does feature some mouse-over tool-tips, but not enough, imo. There also doesn't seem to be a manual that would help with this matter, at least I can't find it, but please correct me if I'm wrong.  Occasionally, I also keep opening info panels when I didn't mean to while trying to move the camera over the map by clicking & dragging with the mouse, which then I try to close with ESC but that just brings up the main menu. Probably a bit nitpicky, but I kind of wish that ESC would be a universal way of closing whatever is currently on your screen. And also making it so that click & holding LMB doesn't open any info panels.  Another minor improvement that I think could be done to avoid confusion, is how the combat window is situated, because it seems like attacking units are always on the left, while defending units are on the right side, which often confuses me because it makes it seem like you are getting attacked from the direction that the enemy units are displayed in the combat window, which then has me wonder if I'm currently actually being attacked from the direction of my main front line, or if this is some attack from units that flanked me and are coming from behind. I'd much prefer if attacker and defender would be highlighted differently, and then instead have the factions displayed in the direction they are actually coming from.  I also wish that there was an option in the menu to pause the displaying of the cards that the enemy plays, so you can read what they do, before they move to the stack of played cards on the left side of the screen.  There also seem to be some performance issues during certain phases of the game, and judging from what I read on the forums, there seem to be a fair amount of people that are affected by this. It's not too bad for me personally, so it's still quite playable, and I assume that this will be fixed.  Like I said in the beginning, quite a few negative points, but it's still a very unique game, and I just love the setting, and the fact that they did a good job with the immersion in the game, it just carries a really cool vibe.  And I'm not going to lie, this game made me hunrgy for some of the other SGS games for sure.  But I'd recommend everyone to at least give this game a try to see if you like it. And if performance issues are too big, then you can still refund and try again in a couple of months once they put out some patches.",1

This game brings a fresh perspective to the genre, offering new mechanics and twists on old favorites that make for a truly thrilling gaming experience.

The problem is that concept is flawed out of the gate.  The main issue is that killing enemies, the players main way of interacting with the game and the thing you will be doing 95% percent of the time, isn't something I want to do. Enemies don't offer any way to progress or grow like experience or currency. Instead, they drop health and fuel, things required to survive especially as fuel drains constantly. With enemies only serving as an obstacle that keeps me alive I don't WANT to kill them, I NEED to kill them. Forced incentive. It feels like being held hostage in a Saw trap; I want to survive and win so I need to force myself to do something I really don't want to do.  I think if there is definite potential in here and some nice ideas. With some reworking I truly think this game could be a lot of fun but as it is right now I can't recommend it.",0

The storyline is fun, it's rare for such games to have tricks, new enemies, etc. coming up and making sense but here it all makes sense, as everything is a show and all fights are set-up. Each character has their own skills and plays a specific role. Early on you're a bit limited on who you fight with (up to 3 characters max) but the end-game lets you play with all your party and it shines.",1
137893640,1669000,"I absolutely love this game, it's easily one of the best 4x titles I have played recently.  HOWEVER This is the pettiest, peskiest, most annoying AI I have ever seen.  In each one of my games so far the AI found extremely creative ways to screw me over.  If the player is reachable by land they love to bee-line into their territory to take out their starting camps, while ignoring their own and at turn 80 the resource nodes near their Throne city are still occupied by the now Tier 4-5 maraduer guards.  I straight up had a neutral AI settle an outpost right next to my Throne city at turn 20, which was then immediately upgraded into a city and then it used IMPERIUM to gain a pop just so that it can steal away 4 of my resource nodes in 2 turns.  It's also hilariously easy to defeat the AI sometimes. It often leaves it's leader pretty much undefended, and you can just summon some units near their throne city if you want to snipe a quick victory.  The diplomacy is also weird, if the enemy leader is dead, you cant negotiate with them, so If you don't have enough grievance you cant declare a justified war until the leader respawns. And it likes to die. A lot.  Allying an AI nation is not worth it, they will never fight eachother. If you grant them open borders, they will just settle a city to the place you wanted to annex, if you give them an ability to annex your claimed provinces, they wont spare any imperium to take all your provinces on your border. If you introduce your ally to your enemy AI they will straight up ally eachother, and screw yo over when you call them to war.  The city states also seem to be idle. They don't seem to like moving out of their territory, if you are at war with a city state, you can mostly ignore them, because even if they miraculously send an army, you will get a notification that they are prepairing to attack you.  The only reason I gave a negative review, because I would like to see the AI impoved.  Also please do something with the water combat, it looks a bit weird.  Otherwise I'm having a lot of fun with the game. I'm playing on an old lower-end computer and despite that I never had perfomance issues, the game runs smoothly in the 30-40 fps range, I have only noticed drops while using massive spells, but that is survivable.",0

137892476,1669000,"One of the best 4X games to come out in the past few years. The amount of customization in the game is amazing. Every run feels different and unique. I do agree with the criticisms that the initial cultures you choose do not feel super unique, especially in the late game. That being said, the tome and affinity system more than makes up for it. It makes me never want to play another historical 4X again with their super rigid factions.  There are so many features that should be in every 4x going forward. Seperate queues for units and buildings? Heroes who can be governors and roam around the map? I'm depth tactical combat with the option to autoresolve?  The game is by no means perfect. There are several annoying problems, like not being able to create a custom faction without starting a game. Or how difficult it is to select units on cities. I fully expect these issues to be cleared up with time, however.  There are a few issues that are far more glaring. Naval combat sucks and oceans are incredibly bland, with almost no reason to expand on to them. Where are the water based magic materials or wonders? Where is the magical tome letting me summon a kraken or other sea monsters. That would go a long way to making the oceans feel more alive. I am also disappointed that there is no desert focused tome. I was really excited to create undead tomb kings from Warhammer, only to find that there was really no way to do that. Also, the lack of flavor text in the game is really disappointing. The units and buildings have super cool designs and names but that's it. It want to know more about these creatures, but aside from a few in game events, there is almost nothing. These are issues that could be fixed in DLC or updates, but it is by no means gaurenteed.

It has simple, yet effective graphics and engaging well conceived puzzles that feel satisfying to solve.  Should take ~1-1.5 hours to finish it, depending on one's puzzle-solving abilities. IMO the game offers a quite acceptable amount of content for its affordable price.  The game's puzzles range from easy to medium difficulty, with a diverse selection of puzzles requiring no skill beyond discerning clues and utilizing tools. Every puzzle possesses sound logic and clearly defined clues.  There arent any vague or confusing mechanics or bugs or clunkyness that could lead to frustration or blaming the game for not being able to figure out a puzzle. If you cant figure out what to do next, you are missing something.  The game's progression is thoughtful and intentional. Almost every object is significant, and the simple graphics facilitate a smooth and stable experience. Sound effects are immersive and provide hints to solving certain puzzles.  The game's inner workings polish is evident, with interactions such as turning keys and opening doors and similar feel ""solid"" if that makes sense.

Then you get some fun power-ups to choose from after each game that reset when you lose or win the campaign.  Plus some training or other events that can affect your team along the way. Takes some practice to learn how to score and defend properly but I just beat the campaign on standard difficulty on my 4th or 5th run. I also played the demo so I was familiar win the game.

For early access the foundation is incredibly solid.   I know next to nothing about hockey, but I’ve played the majority of rogue-likes and this feels fresh for both sides I think by virtue of just the combination alone.   If you’re unfamiliar with the genre the simplest way I can put it is you pick a random cheat code between each match that benefits you in some way and/or can hinder you in others.   The only thing I’d really like to see is maybe a bit more variation on the in between sections  Making your own team, jersey and logo/colors.   Maybe some more unlocks and modifiers but this is the first week so I expect that to come   And some slight tightening up of a few aspects but overall it’s an absolute blast on all fronts.

I Think with the big map it would be good to have both proximity and team chat, like HLL. Go get 'em tiger I'll be playing.",1

137891831,1824960,Amazing game! I waited for this for a long time and it did not disappoint. 10/10,1
137891699,1824960,"Just finished this and I must say that overall, it's a great game. The jump scares are well executed and definitely kept me on edge throughout the experience.  The graphics are stunning and the game play is immersive. However, I was disappointed with the voice acting. It felt lackluster and didn't add much to the overall experience. Additionally, I wish that the story was longer. It felt like it ended too soon and left me wanting more. Despite these flaws, I still recommend giving it a try. The puzzles are challenging and the atmosphere is creepy, making it a great game for horror fans.  I've played my fair share of vr zombie games and this is definitely up there.",1

137892271,1649130,"Here is my stream archive of the game after successfully completing one run. https://youtube.com/live/sGCV2JvrUKA  A gameplay game. The story is very basic. The first choice you have to make is if you want the game to be a roguelike or roguelite. There is only 1 profile so if you want to switch later, you need to erase your progress in the other mode. I can't comment on the roguelike mode for this reason.   Let's start with the cons: The game kind of assumes you know what all the stats mean such as ""acrobatics"" and ""deadly strike"" vs ""critical strike"".   It is also hard to know -why- you got hit often. You can usually know that you did take damage because your character will say something but its hard to know what constitutes as an attack. Since healing is hard to get in this game (you either need to have gear with a chance to proc healing or sacrifice a level up bonus to heal) it would help to know how to dodge attacks.   On the other hand the game is fun. You get some interesting powerups and there is a diablo like drop system. The gameplay loop isn't too long so it can be a nice distraction.",1

137897317,2311190,"Ah, the third iteration of the Garten of Banban trilogy. I would be lying if I said that this game was terrible. The amount of times I was on the edge of my seat after playing through this game could be an undefined number. Constantly, my mind was racing. I was thinking about what would happen next. I'm glad sheriff Toadster was introduced to the game, after being introduced in Garten of Banban II. But first, the game. The game-play is very well thought of. First, the puzzles are very thought out, and could only be created by a set of brilliant individuals. I adore the drone game-play as well, and how you can customize the drone to your specific tastes and likes. Sure, there are some bland parts to the sequel, parts where you are walking around to a certain section. The chasing parts or the tense parts make up for this, though. I was focused and sharp for the whole duration of the game. Possibly one of the best games in the trilogy, game-play wise. (Not to mention the fact that it outcompetes most other indie games) The thing i'm glad about is that the game takes more time, meaning you can't just buy the game and refund it. In my opinion, it makes the game better overall. Secondly, (and my personal favorite) the story. I find the lore and plot of this game to be very perplexing, in a good way. My mind was constantly thinking both inside, and outside the box on how I got to this point in the game. Where is my missing child. Who is Claire? What is this mysterious undocumented element with an atomic number of infinity?  The human mind is naturally curious and desires to collect information. Garten of Banban III exploits this claim. I tell you, this game will make you think in ways you didn't know was humanly possible. There were new characters, making me even more curious about the strange Garten I was in. There are also QR codes on the notes you pick up throughout the game (First introduced in Garten of Banban I), and you can access these notes through the Journal on the Main Menu. I was ecstatic to see more information on ""Uthman Adam"", as he was introduced in Garten of Banban I, and to my knowledge, he was not mentioned anywhere in Garten of Banban II. In Garten of Banban I, you see his boarding pass, making you wonder about his story. You also get to play as different characters for a small duration of the game, giving you more information on these wacky characters, and their stories and contribution to the big plot of the Garten. And finally, the ending. The ending was very, very amazing! Almost all the characters were there. I will not spoil the ending for those who wish to play the game for the first time, but it is there to watch on Youtube. I especially like the reoccurence of the lift, and how you get on it to end the game. What I think is poetic about the game is that when you get on the lift, you are transported deeper into the Garten, game-wise and plot-wise. As you go deeper into the Garten, you even go deeper into the game itself, and its beautiful story line. For anyone reading this, this game (and trilogy) will change you. Whether it's mentally with its brilliant puzzle, or emotionally, with it's dense plot. The only advice I bring to you if you decide to listen and play the trilogy is to keep a box of tissues near your computer while you play this complex human masterpiece.",1
137897217,2311190,"Overall,  A huge step-up from GOB 1 and 2. The puzzles in GOB 3 are difficult and fun. Also, the story is better now.

137897893,1294810,"Every studio has to try something different at some point. Playing this with friends feels like playing a number of other looter-shooters. Four people stroll into a building an holy hell breaks loose because there's no plan and everyone reacts on their own. There's so damn many of you that you make it out ok. Nobody knows the plot, but you're there to hang with your mates and that's the real point.  To that end, the game works. Movement and shooting is good, healing one another is fine. Baddies require some cooperation if there is a lot of them. It's great that there is no loot competition; you can't trade gear and everyone has their own instance of a bag or item to pick up.      The world is pretty, and the plot feels like... Dying Light meets Prey, but with The Strain painted over it?  I'm enjoying it a lot in solo. Lots of things to put together just by reading the notes and looking at the scene. Stealth feels good, but honestly I'm so well equipped that it takes a mob to down me. That's the scaling difficulty, and I haven't decided if I like that yet or not. There is a LOT of Deathloop in this game. A lot. From predictable NPCs to gorgeous and evocative places to discover. AI like that is part of what allows you to hide and take them down. It would be nice if some of the more cunning enemies WERE more cunning, not just able to see you through walls or something...  But consider those four people walking into the building again. If it wasn't a 90 degree cone of vision and an unwillingness to see bodies on the ground, how would you sneak up on them? Alerting one sends up a shout that alerts the pod. One of your friends is going to be half paying attention, blast someone in the head, and ruin your attempt to be a ninja. And you can't Hitman the bodies around, sooo.   Right now people are frustrated. There are some improvements I'd like to see graphically, but I'm definitely enjoying the game.",1
137897515,1294810,I think this game needs working on like the constant glitches. but it is a fun game to play with friends. honestly it's entertaining if you play the game on hard or higher. most of the negative reviews seems to be due to the lack of knowledge and unappreciative attitude towards how much time it takes to get the movement mechanics down in code. I will say it is like all the other games coming out these days which is an incomplete product like halo infinite and cyberpunk 2077. Like many of the reviews I do not agree with the $70 price tag because it is worth less at the moment of this review but it has potential.,1

137896526,1155330,"OK, so I just finished this game, and yeah, I'm prepared to say it was pretty good.  GAMEPLAY: if you've played XCOM 2 then you'll know what to expect. On tactical battles, the game plays just like XCOM 2, except 1) the chance to hit/miss seems more not-BS than in XCOM, 2) crits just don't exist so it all feels a bit more even, 3) all units in play are always revealed, so there's no risk of activating a pod if you run a bit too far, and 4) curveballs will occasionally be dropped into the tactical map to change things up. Between combat encounters you explore a little area (walking around in 3rd person) for more weapons and money, with some fairly simple puzzles of the Saw variety where getting things wrong takes your health away. There's healing stations everywhere, though, so it's less annoying than you might thing. And between stages you visit a hubworld to talk to your team mates; there's no research, no companion reputation, you're mostly just there to engage with the story and setting a bit more, like touching down on the Citadel in Mass Effect 1. There's some design decisions I don't [i]get[/i], like the different armour types that allow you to do extra damage if you have a corresponding weapon. It's a nice idea, but given that the specialised weapons don't do as much damage and you're usually facing 5 types of armour with 2 or 3 people, it doesn't seem worth optimising for that. There's also a few different consumable items, but I managed to get all the way through using only medikits and grenades. The proximity mines are only really useful against reinforcements and would only hurt one enemy in a group, while the shield just sat in my pocket, never being used as attacking was always a much better idea. All of that is stuff that is there that I am in no real obligation to use so, whatever. In terms of complaints, I don't really have that many. People have said it's short, and while it is shorter than a game of XCOM, I don't count that against it; it's a curated experience, rather than a series of procedurally-generated encounters. It'll last you about 13 hours if you play like an aggressive maniac like I do, so it doesn't outstay its welcome. I did get a few performance issues towards the end of the game, couple of bugs here and there, but those will probably get patched out eventually and they didn't get in the way too much. Most of the puzzles were fine, except there was one in the penultimate area where you had to rotate a bunch of boxes to lower a crate, and I could not figure out what I was supposed to be doing. Eventually the crate dropped, and I could not tell you how I solved that puzzle.  STORY: I've seen people compare the setting to Smash TV, but I'm too young to have played it so imagine Squid Game meets Saw and Borderlands. In a dystopian world that is once again significantly more interesting than our own, Scarlett enters into a deadly TV game show where she has to murder a whole bunch of convicts and cybernetic mutants to get a big cash prize at the end. Along the way she teams up with a few other contestants, each with their own distinct personality and voice. The story takes a few turns along the way - fairly predictable turns, mind - but in the end, story in a tactics game is mostly there as glue to hold it together, and it works perfectly fine there. The only complaint I have here is that while one of your companions seems invested in you winning the game, the rest of them just kinda seem to be there, and their presence in the last stage comes across as a bit of an oddity.  GRAPHICS: I mean, if you're playing a tactical game for the graphics, then you were probably born on opposite day. That said, the game is very visually striking, with concrete and metal contrasting with blood, neon, and fire. There's a lot of dismemberment in view, which I'm of two minds about; yes, it's cool and kinda funny to hit a guy with a shotgun and cause his legs to fly off, but it happens a little bit [i]too[/i] often. How about, instead of it happening randomly, it happens if the damage you do is double that of their remaining HP? (Or maybe such a system already exists and I was playing the game too well.) There's a lot of particle effects that can make performance drop a bit, and that was a particular problem in later cutscenes.  ATMOSPHERE/MUSIC: the music is actually really good. I watched the credits and I noticed that two of the people who wrote music for this game also wrote some for Cyberpunk 2077, another game with good music. The game has a bit of B-movie air to it, all the dismemberment and reality TV stuff is done in deliberately bad taste, and it works. You feel like part of the audience, invested a little in your characters' survival, but mostly just going ""oooooohhh"" when something blows up in particularly spectacular fashion.  CONCLUSION: if you liked XCOM, then you'll probably like Showgunners. Hell, maybe if you didn't like XCOM for the RNG or the ambushes, maybe you'll still like this, as some of the more irritating design issues in the former game have been ironed out here. Don't take any of my complaints as dealbreakers (they're probably more of use to the devs than to you tbh); the game is very strong overall, and fairly-priced for the content too.",1

Yes you cant even found a another city before u already run into npc's or other players and im not talking about free cities. And yes we tried the workshop mod but it makes unstable (unplayable) game even more unstable.  And another one. Not enough units. Only 10 T5 units and half of them are ""unobtainable"". Well you probably can obtain them somehow but not due to normal means. Each faction only has like 5 units up to t3. No racial units like in AoW3 had.

Big wall of meat in front of net tries to stop me from getting point and others on the field try to body check/poke steal the puck from me.  With that being said,  This game is a absolute f**king BLAST to play. It really brings me back to the PS2 days of Blitz: The League which I spent quite a bit of my life playing. So this game plays into my heart strings a bit, plus I'm a sucker for Unity games for whatever reason. They're just almost always a good time to play.  Please keep up the great work. This game is probably a 6.5-7/10 to most, but a 9/10 to me.  Side notes: It helps to yell at your players when they're playing s**t defense/offence, but give credit where credit's due for both sides. Good sportsmanship is always the key to victory. People might say some spots of this game feels cheap/unfair.

137896126,2337630,"AFL23 likely has the potential to be the best AFL game released on recent gen consoles/Steam.  With every patch that has been released across just three days, I've experienced massive improvements in gameplay features. Although at the moment it may still not be worth it for some, with a couple more patches I see this as a polished product worth its cost.  A few issues I still run into after these patches: -Player after receiving the ball sometimes does not start sprinting immediately/sometimes runs backwards -The kicking while running animation is too slow to the point where I need to send out aimless handballs to not get pinged for holding the ball -If you handball while being tackled, it will either go right in front of your character, or 50m down the field, neither of which is in direction of where you pointed the handball. -If you try to do a quick press of a button to handball without any power added (even if directed somewhere), it will go to closest player regardless of whichever team member it happens to be. -If you mark the ball in front of your (both defending and scoring) goal, but then cross the goal-line, it says it counted the mark, but then it gets called a rushed behind. ""He rushed a behind for his own team! Can't say I've seen that one before!"" gah. -Players double their sprinting speed to try to mark a ball. -Tackling just aint working how it should. I've been moving the right stick on defense when getting close to opponent. Will bump them to the ground and sometimes ping for holding the ball. Triangle/Y rarely does anything defensively -Marking is too easy, doesn't seem too affected by timing/positioning. Also I can't bump/do anything to opponents during a marking contest -Please sooner rather than later give us some controller information so I don't have to rely on a 1MB screenshot from someone's live stream of AFL23's first public showing. -AI is good at providing pressure, however they move the ball way too much and way too quickly once they have it. For a quick patch, set the AI to actually take their set shots at goal after the siren instead of passing it off because they're near the 50m arc. -Ability to bounce ball while sprinting pls -Anyone who's played season mode has seen the bald headed coach at quarter/3 quarter time instead of your actual coach -Players get too congested after a ball up or centre bounce. Given no options to handball to that aren't going to get tackled just as easily. -Set shots are a bit scrappy. I've been trying to hit shoot on the second power meter before it goes to the blue and it seems to work better. If we are not meant to touch the button when it is in the blue, then wouldn't a better colour be red?  That's about it from me. Still enjoying the game! Would recommend to casual sports game players who are looking for a new game to try out in about a month's time. Would recommend to anyone who plays sports games who love AFL, it really is enjoyable.",1

137895969,1375900,"Upgrades don't feel significant. Unless you get a lucky run, it takes you 5-6 runs to afford a 50 shard upgrade to get +10% damage with a specific weapon type.   During game upgrades are also all over the place on usefulness. There are some that are mandatory, so pray that you get them (Arsenal) and others that are barely useful at all like burn damage. What good is a 10% chance to inflict a very slow, low damage burn on the enemy when unless you're one shotting them, you get overrun and lose?  Hopefully the game improves as EA goes on. I'll try it out again if I see any significant updates.",0

Also, all the weapons and items are fantastic you can tell how much time and effort went into the small details such as my personal favorite the Meatball Cannon it's just genius whoever thought of this idea needs a pay raise.

It has a very interesting and quirky concept which I enjoy. The simple yet sophisticated melee combat system allows for great fighting and the vast array of weapons and craftables also adds to this depth.

114706778,1557990,A complicated game that offers a lot of interesting ideas but i dont think it will take off. The game is taken from the idea of a popular Roblox game mixed with Battle Royale. It isnt a good game but same time isnt bad. Id like to see better climbing mechanics and less locked chests. Loot drops and supplies very unbalanced as well. Seeing where players will land before game starts is very silly. I think the concept of coming out of a box early game is funny. The other issue is leveling up is slow and glitchy. You can start a game with no one but your self and get a win too if you die.   For how long this game has been tested it needs more work.,0

137899275,1294810,"All the negative reviews aren’t exaggerating. It’s not another case like Forspoken which was actually a good game but it was just trolled by incels and racists. It’s not like the review bombing of The Last of Us, which is another great game but it couldn’t run well on potatoes so butthurt third world peasants got upset over it.  From a technical perspective this game runs fine and should play okay on potatoes. The problem here is simply that the gameplay is trash. This game is not AAA. While it meets some basic technical criteria you’d expect from a AAA title like native HDR & ultrawide support, every other aspect of the game is underwhelming. Aside from the nice looking HDR, the graphics look more like a launch PS4/Xbox One title than a 2023 PC game. The AI is terrible. The open world is empty and not fun to explore. The quests themselves are boring and generic as it gets: go here, find a key, open a door, fight some zomb- I mean “vampires”. It doesn’t even have animated cutscenes, instead telling the story via still images thag look like storyboards created before animating the final cutscene.   Redfall is like a really bad clone of Back 4 Blood. It’s got that same ‘designed for co-op’ feel as Borderlands, Gotham Knights, Dead Island 2, etc. with absolutely none of the fun or polish of those games. Seriously, this game makes Gotham Knights feel like a game of the year contender. Everything about Redfall screams ‘low budget’, which doesn’t make any sense. It’s a high budget $70 game that feels more like a mediocre indie game made by a small team. I felt like I was playing an alpha build of a game that isn’t supposed to have its final release for another 18-24 months from now. You shouldn’t feel like you’re playing a brand new Steam Early Access game when the product costs $70. I’m just thankful I received it from an Nvidia bundle because if I paid for this game specifically I would have refunded it.  Perhaps I will revisit this title in a couple years after it’s had tons of patches and any DLC all finished and attempt a co-op playthrough with my wife. Maybe Arkane will be able to improve it from being a ‘bad game’ to being at least ‘average’, but I’m skeptical. I doubt they will ever be able to bring this up to the quality level of other ‘designed for 4 player co-op’ games. What a tarnish on Microsoft’s brand; they should fire the suit who signed off on releasing this game in this state.",0

The top tier is now 5, but it's limited by resource needed for improving the empire.   The city building feels relevant now, as you have options to repurpose different tiles for speciality uses, but you still need different tile types to be able to build certain city improvements.

Great game, considering it is a one man band, or was, I hope Bohemia will put people to this as this is a little gem of a game already.  Things currently missing: -aerial units (in game files already so coming) -deleting or refunding buildings and units -bugs with harvesters need fixing asap -when a player jumps into a vehicle, for the commander, the player icon remains on the ground (weird glitch) -smooth 3D camera rotation instead of the binary switch currently in game -Music and atmosphere of the maps is top quality -chat once filled up gets bugged (it is not a scrolling one and stays open, obstructing view with old text)  The gamer base is really cool, really communicative and always up for fun, I had some great fun in this. Being a commander in this is soo rewarding, people ask for a vehicle, you build it and then you watch the destruction. It is awesome.  The FPS part is also really good, and people seem to enjoy the game a lot.",1

137899178,1494420,"Somewhat Neutral Review-  I want to start off by saying I do recommend this game, however....there is still much labor needed from we end users and the developers before this game should be considered a finished product.  THE GOOD:  Silica is a refreshing take on the blended FPS/RTS genre where the age old conflict of us versus them (humans versus aliens), because resources. $$$ The maps are expansive, and there appears to be freedom for commanders to build in most places of the battlefield The community so far is generally supportive and friendly  THE BAD:  Balance- 1. Human basic unit stomps the bug basic unit and can generally be annoying to some of the larger bug units, so in general human units are more well rounded.  Commander Role- 1. In my extremely limited experience so far the FPS player role is generally easier to jump into versus the commander role. I've experienced cases where many a bug commander is asking to switch with other players due to ""unexpected complexity"" or general disinterest in the position. I've seen a similar problem with a pretty successful title (Natural Selection) where the commander role risk wasn't appealing enough for most players to give it a go without being flamed or blamed for the outcome of a skirmish. I have yet myself to try commander role in either the Human or Bug team for this similar reason, and I would consider myself an RTS enthusiast. (I'm going to try commander today and see whats what)  Feedback loops- 1. For FPS players the GUI is more minimalist so things like HUD and health for bugs is pushed to the side ( I understand why it's done that way, however many a time unless a massive stream of missiles, gunfire, or plasma blots out my unit there really isn't enough feedback to tell me I should GTFO or i'm going to die)  Player Team Interaction- 1. So far unless you fancy typing everything to your commander there really aren't enough mechanics that directly encourage players to work together. Yes the Commander can set objectives and mark locations or units on your map, however (this may be ignorance on my part) I have not seen much in the way of FPS players being able to request resources or change of direction from the commander without breaking immersion and requiring them to type in chat.  Optimization- 1. I understand that this game is Early Access, and it clearly states this, so this is more of a cautionary statement for players who want to jump into the game in its current state. So the game defaulted my settings to 'high' and it runs at a screaming 28-30fps granted that I have changed the settings to 'medium' providing mild performance gains of near 30-35fps. I currently run a GTX 3080TUF, 32GB Memory, AMD 3700X chipset, on a Corsair MP600 Gen4 m.2 drive so I'm expecting to at least run the game on high somewhere around 60fps for which it doesn't.   Text Communication- 1. As previously mentioned in the review and I can confirm that at this time of writing the only way for FPS player to communicate with the Commander is via typing. This breaks immersion, and to top it off there's a an odd bug where eventually the chat GUI starts overlapping the last message and the chat box no longer presents updated conversations which can be pretty frustrating seeing as this is the primary communication platform. Devs please fix!!!  NICE TO HAVES:  Humans - 1. Please add a melee unit (It would be interesting to include a human foot solider unit with melee capability possibly to include a jump pack for maneuvering in and out of close combat with bugs)    Bugs -  1. Please consider a tunneling unit. (currently the base bug unit can burrow in its the current position, however it would be far more interesting to add a unit that can improve mobility for their team by creating tunnels to allow for other bugs to traverse in many cases abysmal distances only to meet their untimely death by the superior range humans have. Bugs currently lack in mobility in comparison to the human team's array of vehicles) 2. Please consider allowing the base bug unit attach/detachment to larger bugs as a mode of transportation.   VOIP Communication- 1. Please consider adding voice over protocol to encourage other methods for teams to communicate among themselves. This should include being able to mute players as needed, and there really isn't a need to allow cross team communication.  VERDICT:  Promising- Overall I'm very interested to see where this game goes, and have high hopes for the Dev team.   I will modify my review based on my own experiences, feedback from the community, and as the developers continue to add content and refine the game play mechanics. (I expect to make frequent edits to this post, so please call me on my bullshit :])",1

137901428,1269300,"Single player mode significantly detracts from the game; the game would have been better without its inclusion. This is especially true if its inclusion was to the detriment of the multi-player experience (resulting from either development time or balance decisions).  The primary game loop centers on the distribution of duties between crew members (whether human or AI). However, coordination with the AI is a non-starter. You can give them very primitive instructions (toggle which actions they're permitted to perform) - but can't set any priority for them. In other words, a crew member that only repairs/carries ammo will choose arbitrarily which of the two they intend to do.  As the AI scripts are entirely arbitrary, the only way to coordinate is wait for them to do something good and then hope you're in a position to take advantage of it. Weapon synergies are severely hindered - relying on you to use both weapons (first to reduce armor, second to do damage); but even without synergy, you can't focus fire to take out systems before the enemy weapons overwhelm your defenses. Sure, you can fire at whatever they hit, but the chance of useful timing or target selection is effectively nil. (E.g., they wait to hit targets - hitting a wall to space crew or partially charged weapons with a long wind-up.)  'Noncombat events' require you to run around your ship/spacewalk and collect items. Like combat, this system is clearly designed for a multiplayer experience. The 'solution' to balance this for single-player is to reduce the number of pickups needed while having the AI sit in the ship twiddling their thumbs. Firstly, this linear balance ignores the non-linear benefit of additional players (shared vision means when one player moves forward, all players gain the benefit of increased sight range). Second, even were it perfectly balanced the visibly idle crew may as well be the devs shouting 'the woefully incomplete single-player experience was tacked on/left in as a marketing afterthought'.  TL;DR: It *can* be worthwhile if you are playing in a group of 3-4, or 'barely passable' with 2 if they accept a stripped down version of the game going in. However, the game is a 'tactics puzzle' that treats 'RNG AI crew scripting' as an equivalent alternative to human players.",0

137899789,2311190,"When I was first gifted this game, a rush of euphoria overcame me. Garten of banban 3??? There's a third?? Goody gee golligers, I was so excited to install. The second I hit the play button, I instantly saw all my favourite characters. They were all so well written from banban 1 and 2. When I saw that there was 3 new characters, I was like??? WHAAAT? I was so excited to see them! When I loaded in to the game, I was greeted with 5 minutes of padding followed by another 3 minutes of padding. This already had me at maximum euphoria, it was so representative of the other games. Once I was in the arboreal sector, I saw my favourite character, dynamax Stinger Flynn. He brought me to his expansion realm where he lectured me about having a soul, the character development was so good that I even muted my headphones and listened to music instead of his monologue. After the 6 minutes of padding was done, I set out to go do the most pointless and tedious quest ever, Nabnaleena's amazing minigame. I loved how every 3 seconds the pipes would flip in an attempt to kill you multiple times so you had more playtime. Fortunately, I'm older than 8 years old and I don't have down syndrome so I was able to overcome this. After this, I set back off to go give Nabnab his girlfriend. It was so good until the nefarious Stinger Flynn struck again! Even more padding! I was so shocked when I was transported to the car, I saw my game-crush, Opeila Bird and instantly started panting. I was so close to her! After Flynn crashed in to a cactus with the most unrealistic physics in a game so far, I began my quest to see his awful character development again. I set out to see my favourite part of a game, PADDING! I LOVE PADDING! PADDING IS MY FAVOURITE! The 8 repeated rooms to see a menial boss had me so excited, especially when the same button flashed 3 times in a row, meaning I had little to no involvement except pressing m1 in the same area while avoiding the projectile spit (that is actually just a cyan ball with the help of the unity particle system). After the engaging, anxiety raising and PADDED bossfight, I set out to commit a child kidnapping and began to ride my favourite Opeila Bird reskin. I had to push a robot that kept repeating the same annoying voiceline 3 times in a row. It was really lovely to hear ""THREE STONES WITH ONE BIRD!"" while I pushed a budget FNAF endoskeleton across a monotextured floor. I really loved the chase scene where the same rooms repeated about 20 times, it had me on the edge of my seat when I had to slightly press S or W to avoid dying to the free animation EVIL BanBan chasing me. Once the game ended, I loved the laughably low quality animation, it shows how much the developers really care about how their game is presented. Once I took the elevator away with my child slave, I cried. It was the end of BanBan 3 and I had no reason to go on anymore.  Overall Garten of BanBan 3 is an amazing game with hours of dialogue that will leave you on the edge of your seat because you fell asleep from boredom, coming to a total of 33~ minutes of padding. The pride the developers have clearly taken in their game with the reused content, tedious puzzles and pointless dialogue shows how much they care about the community. I can't wait for Garten of Carbon Copy 4, I believe this game will be better than the last. Truly a great experience from the Euphoric Brothers.  EDIT: I was still able to refund despite having 2+ hours of playtime thanks to the steam gift refund service, thank you so kindly. I really regretted refunding this after extorting my friend of his last spends to play Peak of PeakPeak Peak.",1

137899455,2373540,"First Level:  Cutscene was interesting, also 'new powers called bursts', yo i'm boutta burst. Anyway. It was interesting, but feels rushed. It lacks any introduction to set up the characters. It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad.  Initial gameplay: The mouse may or may not disappear during gameplay. It is inconsistent. Just food for thought. The camera does not feel very comfortable. It zooms in too frequently and aggressively. However, it feels fluid. The model for the main character is very clean but the skin and weapon of the character are ever so slightly transparent. The animations feel crisp, but a bit fast. They look fantastic though. Movement tech feels good, jumping and dashing, there are combos.  Also, as I tested jumping, I have found a way to break out of the first level before moving outside of the spawn area. I am based af, get outplayed level designe bro (with love). Okay, moving on from that. I am going to proceed to the rest of the level and give final thoughts after. I feel pausing to explain mechanics might be a tad unnecessary, and that a more live instruction would be better. Mushroom jiggle kinda cute tho, ngl. My temps are at 82c, please fix devs. Thank. Yo, why your bush got collision bro? YOUR INVISIBLE WALLS CAN'T STOP ME, MR LEVEL DESIGNER. i AM BECOME GOD. Circe got me barkin' bro. 10/10 art. I pray she slay me. The character models are all transparent in certain spots, which isn't fantastic but isn't an overall issue. They also do not reflect the sprites very well. Yo, Zhao better be buyin' me dinner if he finna feel my blood. Unironically, all of the facial expressions for the art are amazing. Very good job with those. When entering the camp, new music that's a bit more relaxed would be appreciated, as the constant hype music can pull away from the feeling I get when I'm in the camp of safety. Proceeding, the camera is incredibly jarring when jumping and navigating. The enemies don't have a clear animation for attacking, so I'm unsure when to dodge and how. I remained locked on to something that is dead as well. Some of the rocks have fall animations when stood on. Due to the lack of visual representation of attack animations, I was forced to circumvent the enemies in the first section by breaking boundaries (because I was able to go over the invisible walls) to get to the next checkpoint with minimal combat interaction. I felt I needed to do this because I am taking damage I don't feel I am able to avoid. Continuing rest of review from next checkpoint. The mushroom jump part was super fun, but holy ungodly fuck the camera is terrible, I'm sorry. First hidden enemy with the free shards was based, I rolled that mutt. Good design though, looked cool. Bones before the first boss? Okay, now I see we're REAL gamers. Time to get boned. AGITATED BREATHING. Why did bro post up with his package POPPIN'? Curious. Aight, the boss fight starts and he walkin' stankly leg at me, what's goin' on? Animations were tight but this shit loose. The objective is clipping into the bosses health, also, I'm beating him up crazy from the outside of the arena, and he can't get out. Level designer, what's good bro. Level 1, done.  Second Level:   Bad news Level 2 designer, I got out at the beginning again. I'm 0/2 on level designers. Level 3, watch yourself. I will give you credit though, I had to actually work to get out of this level, unlike Level 1. I broke out of that shit first try, and broke out CONSTANTLY throughout the level. Moving on. Platforming in Level 2 is alright, but the camera still makes it difficult. Also, clipped through a rock while jumping which was not great. For the first large combat room, you did a fantastic job of blocking off almost every option to sequence break. I was able to find a method, but it took about 25 minutes, and some creativity. So very well done with the level protection, and the room was well designed as well. Moving on to the second section. The lock on feature will reveal enemies around corners if held. This is a design flaw y'all. No spookin' ME! Instead of going the obvious route, I opted for the climb and fought some of the first bandits. I explored for a good long while looking for a way to NOT fight the enemies in that room with the 4 bandits and 2 birds. It took me a long time, but I was able to break through the wall and get around that room. Again, lots of effort required, very well done protecting the level. I was also able to reach the desert from this exploit and avoided the next fight room as well. The desert was well designed, and the mechanic took me awhile to actually figure out. I did realize it was akin to madness in bloodborne, but the actual cause being the sunlight didn't click. If I hadn't sequence broke the game, I would have seen the tutorial. Quirky. Took me awhile, good job. Also, fuck that bandit room, y'all wrong for that. First time having my health low enough to make the warning sound. That shit cute. MEEP. I love it. Sound design so far for both levels has been very good. I have no critique regarding that (yet). I have arrived at the next boss. The climb up to the boss was very fun. First thing to find out - Can I break out of the arena and cheese this nerd. Will report soon. I could not. Voice acting for 2nd boss is very good. Why he INHALIN' LIKE THAT THOOOO YOOOOOO. Bro hit the za crazy in that moment. YOOO HE POSIN'. BRO SAID ERASE THESE HOES. I went into the boss with no health potions, 3 corruption and 9 damage. I cannot use the damage ones, uncool bro. The bosses hit boxes are a bit large, and I did encounter a bug where his spinning attack would presist damage despite the fight restarting and him just standing there. This can be fixed by dying again. This fight is interesting, with the mechanic being thrown as a addition. That took 17 attempts, and I want you to know I was self nerfed as hard as possible. My health was at 5% total. I had used the other 95% to spam abilities throughout the mission. It wasn't a bad fight, but the boss was a bit spammy. Good second level though, all things considered. Level 2, done.  Rest of my review in the replies, as I don't have space.",1
137901331,2323570,"Full playthrough here: https://youtu.be/PQG-WUKZnlE  Honestly I wish game creators would go the opposite way with the voice volume where it's too loud and you have to turn it down instead of where it's too quiet when it's at max cause the voice acting sounded good. The ending was pretty rough too kind of hard to understand what happened or if we even accomplished anything I'm honestly not even sure that was the ending, but the game ended so I guess? It's not bad for a free to play, and one of the monsters literally scared the heck out of me.",1

137905572,1294810,"Just finished the game on 2nd hardest difficulty (since the hardest is unlocked after at least 1 playthrough kindve like a ng+) so here's my take:  Positives:   The world is make well. Whatever devs were in charge of the world building and maps did a great job in my opinion, there isn't much repetitive content laying around other than vehicles and the map feels like a real place at times. Could it have been better sure, especially for a 70$ game, however it is one of the games very few better points.  The voice acting, i feel like every character in the game with voice lines (which i think is everyone) did a great job. Was the dialog generic and repetitive? yep! did the VA's do a good job reading the lines? also yep! The studio really didn't put too much work into recording a lot of lines, but the ones that are in the game were voiced well.. thats about it.   thats about it...  The Negatives:   The gun variety.. It's crap, it's dogshit, it's downright bad. For a game who's previews spouted all sorts of nonsense about gun variety and this and that, After your first hour of playing congrats! you have officially probably seen every single gun this game has to offer. Random rolls on guns? sure here's maybe 6 different lines every single gun can roll and that's it. I wasn't expecting borderlands levels of variety for gear but this game literally has pistols, ar's, shotguns, snipers, flareguns, uv guns, and spike launchers. Each with 2 or maybe 3 varieties, and very VERY minimally different stats, ie: double barrel shotty vers standard combat shotty. Slow firing harder hitting AR and a faster lightly hitting AR. The random rolls they get from green to purple rarity has something like 6 different stats they can roll and most of these stats you really have no idea what they change on the weapon. Added accuracy? ok what while aiming? while moving? bullet spread? bullet drop? NO IDEA! Anyways.. this was one of the major killers of this game for me, is after about 1-2 hours of playing you have experienced everything you are  going to see out of this looter shooter's gunplay. Even the legendary guns are just slightly beefed up regular guns with designated skins you can't change..No they do not add additional effects like ""this gun poisons on hit"" the most unique legendary line is something along the lines of ""this gun can kill vampires without staking them"". Overall when you get a legendary gun, it doesn't feel very good or rewarding, especially when you very VERY rarely come across legendaries.  The Legendaries: Feel sooooooo badddddd mannnn.... As i explained above, they are just so bland and boring how could you possibly feel like you are using a unique or legendary weapon when it feels exactly like any other weapon of its type? there is a single legendary line ""this gun can kill vampires without staking them"" that actually feels unique since the only other way to kill a vamp is with a flar, uv light and smash, or stake. Every other legendary is just a slightly stronger version of a regular gun.   Gun Rarities: ill keep this short. Gun and blood rarities were such a waste of time to even implement into this game. Whats rarity boil down to in this game? From white -> legendary, it just means its slightly stronger. Sure higher rarities roll more lines of effects, it's too bad there is only maybe 6 lines that guns can roll! Therefore pretty much every single gun feels the same! Added line of accuracy? yeah no you arn't going to notice that. Added line of dmg? wow gun hits slightly harder.. how fun and what a unique game design! +2 to mag size? Ok... you get my point. Rarities dont mean shit when there is only a small handful of effects things can roll. If youre anything like me you'll blaze through the game at normal, spend 10 seconds looking at if the numbers of a new gun are slightly higher, if they are you equip it and keep moving. Nothing will feel much different, nothing will feel new and refreshing. For a looter shooter this feels like shit.  The vamps and goonies: Here is the list of enemies you'll run into in game: Shotgunner, Sniper, Assault Gunner, Regular Vamps, Vamps with shields rotating around them, Anglers vamps that grab you and bite hard, Shade vamps that slightly blind you and shoot homing projectiles at you, the ""rook"" basically a tank vamp, the bloodbag kamikaze vamp, and lastly the siphon that has a bullshit blood suck ranged ability you have to stagger to stop. TEN....TEN ENEMIES IN THE ENTIRE GAME MINUS BOSSES.... just that one sentence would've prevented me from purchasing this game if had known before. The vamps themselves will look exactly the same throughout your entire playthrough, the human enemies will have slightly different outfits depending on which vamp god they worship but they literally all act the exact same. THER IS ZERO VARIETY IN ENEMIES. ugh.. this one kills me the most.   The ""Bosses"": Let me start with, there are 2 maps in this game and each map has safehouses that give a measly 2 missions each. The first a generic, go here and kill or loot this quest. The second, always a hunt for a vampire ""boss"".. no... just no.. its a regular vampire out of the list of 4 vamps (there is no rook or blood bag varient of boss). The ""boss"" will have a name and 3 health bars... that's it.. no special abilities, no special loot, no special location to fight them in, nothing... I killed half of the safehouse mission bosses not even knowing it was a boss as i was making my way to where i thought they would be hiding... Absolutely zero effort given into making these fights feel special or anything. Let's continue... There are 4 main story bosses in the base game as well, which you will have to fight eventually as you progress through the story. These bosses felt unique and slightly challenging and fun to fight all except the final boss....   The Final Boss:..... WHAT THE FUCK... This is it, you have slogged through this completely uncreative, unmotivated, lazy ass half assed rushed assed game, and you've made it to presumably the best fight in the game right? NOPPPPPE. I can explain this fight in a single sentence. You walk in, see the boss and notice its attached to 3 different crystals of which you then break and the boss dies. BAM, ya did it champ. The few vampires that are left alive after the fight is over put up more of a fight than the final all powerful boss does. You heard that correctly.. you literally do not fire a single bullet into the final boss. It is tethered to 3 different crystalized vamps which you need to stake while being chased by a bunch of other vampires. Sure this might be difficult if the vamp ai was somewhat capable of chasing you over anything larger than a 6 inch step up in height, but is turns out you can just ezpz run to each crystal, stake it, and boom the fight is done. You proceed to walk over to the boss and plunge a stake into its heart and that's it. The vampire capable of blocking the sun with some sort of magic, powerful enough to lift millions of tons of ocean water off the ground and hold it there for weeks without trying... doesn't put up a single finger to stop you from trying to kill it.. Even after pushing through the game and getting use to the blandness that is redfall, this fight still had me in a stuper.. how the hell could the company who finalized this think anybody would have been satisfied with this?   The ""cutscenes"": They are slideshows.. Yeah all those fancy animated trailers and previews you watched of the game with the characters acting all cool and all? Yeh nope... that doesn't exist.. they spent more money on the advertising animating budget than the actual game animated scenes... fun 70$ right!?  Ugh.. You can pretty much tell i can't do anything other than rant. This review and pretty much any other review of Redfall is going to be a long winded rant, because there is hardly anything good to say about this game..   Do NOT buy this game till its 20$ or less.",0
137905252,1294810,"A solid open world game with excellent level design, beautiful environments, captivating storyline and a decent character development. While the game is a bit buggy in some places so far I've not encountered anything game breaking. If you liked games like Dishonored or Prey, then you will  definitely enjoy this. The choice of different characters adds a bit of replayability although on the other hand the lack of character choices makes the gameplay fairly linear. While it certainly has room for improvement it is nonetheless overall a pretty solid game and worth recommending.",1
137905203,1294810,"Got it for free with my new card, but definitely wouldn't recommend buying it unless it was on a heavy sale. Artificial difficulty of enemies just being bullet sponges and you'd have to do 4 playthroughs to experience each character in a solo run. Haven't even tried online as I figured it would just be a dumpster fire. I'm trying to give it an honest chance but it's just not catching on for me.",0

137903838,1294810,Its a pretty fun game.  I have no idea why it is being review bombed.  It does need some optimization and AI/network work to improve enemy reactions but I have not had many major issues.,1

It's really as bad as the reviews make it out to be. 2 hours into the game, I tried my hardest to find something positive about the game. There's no fun here. It stutters constantly (I have a 7800x3d for context). The AI is really brain dead. They either let you walk past them, can't shoot or they try shooting you a hundred yards away with shotguns lol. The vampires are supposed to be harder foes but they are just as brain dead and easy to kill themselves. The missions are pointless. NPCs are so bland. The combat is very bland. Visually, this game belongs in 2014. There's nothing ""wow"" about it visually. The game has the nerve to have multiple visual bugs including just terrible texture pop-in/20-30 seconds for high res textures to load. Just stay away from this game.  I received this game free with the purchase of my GPU a month ago. I want money back for my time wasted here.",0
137905336,1155330,If you like turn-based games like X-COM you will have a lot of fun with this game.

No but for 10+ hours of good old turn based combat it gets a thumbs up!  As a heads up there isn't really much build variety and in the end everyone will have everything unlocked.,1

137905662,1669000,Can't really write a review about the game.  I spent more time loading it up than running the game.  Crashed on turn 1-5 about 7 times.  Why release a game with this many bugs?,0
137905516,1669000,"I came to this game having played none in the series and with zero awareness of the franchise.  Didn't matter at all: AOW4 is quickly becoming one of my favorite games of all time....  PROS: Extremely systems-rich and endlessly replayable.  Incredibly streamlined and functional UI considering how complex everything is.  And you really won't believe how deep the customization and emergent storytelling is until you play it.  It's COMPLETELY next-level.  Fans of fantasy strategy games, especially those with RPG elements, need look no further than AOW4; it's got it all.  CONS: Nothing major, just gripes.  The graphics can be hit and miss, and the sound design is the weakest part of the game.  The tactical battles sometimes feel a little clunky.  But again, these are minor gripes.  I got this at full price and have zero regrets.  This is a worthy game of the year for 2023 and, knowing Paradox, I'm sure it'll receive healthy support for years to come.",1
137905394,1669000,"I was looking forward to this game, but even so it exceeded my expectations.   AOW4 is not a by the numbers sequel. It brings a lot of welcome refinements and makes some innovations as well.   It has a really fun 'Overpowered vs Overpowered' balance philosophy that is one of the most difficult to pull off. But it does so very convincingly.   I'm a big fan of the custom race creator as well. A lot of options there.  There are some teething issues with the UI, and I'm frustrated that you have to do voodoo workarounds to edit existing Godir.  However, I'm impressed by what's in our hands already, and I'm sure we're in for some patches soon that will elevate this game from just really good to a masterpiece of the genre.",1

137904692,1669000,"tl;dr: if you want Master of Magic as it mostly was, the remake is over there and honestly pretty decent. If you want a game that makes you FEEL like Master of Magic did, immersing you in the vibe of a fantasy conqueror-hero, we finally have it, um, nearly thirty years later.  Believe me, I've been looking.  I've bounced off all the previous AoW games for various reasons, and this one has fixed, well, pretty much all of them. There are more and more meaningful options to customise your character, faction, and power set, all of which have implications through a given game and add replay value. City management is more interesting and less reliant on spam settling, while the tactical and strategic combat are as interesting as ever (the fix to the ""add nearby stacks to a battle"" system is particularly noteworthy). The magic is powerful enough to be fun and varied enough to hit all kinds of different fantasy aesthetics.  Also despite being surprisingly pretty for a 4X, loading times are snappy even on my low-end CPU and I haven't had any technical issues once I got the settings dialed in, and I have to laud all the UI/tooltipping/documentation work that's been done over previous iterations - but all told I'll say that this game has eaten my week and I still have so many things I want to try - a triumph from Triumph, bravo.",1

I played on low as it was the only way I could play at around 20 frames when all the bullets started flying.

I think most people have pointed those out (Harvesters man they look so cool but they're ridiculously slow).

137904022,1824960,"Okay so the ground work and mechanics for this game are very good, sound design and atomosphere was very good. Guns felt great. However enemies felt much faster than you forcing you to fight rather than give you the option of running/avoiding, and the whole game being claustrophobic corridors makes the dodge feature useless except for a few set pieces. The hotel also feels very small, you are given 2 floors to fully explore in a 7 floor hotel, it would have been nice if it really leaned into the resident evil back tracking puzzle aspect, along with some procedural loot and zombies rather than it being scripted.  Now the story, the story is very bare bones find your sister in zombie apocolypse. The FAQ said this game is about 4 hours in length, I took my time, and finished the game in 2.6 hours steam time, 2 hours 5 minutes IGT, this game ends VERY suddenly, and my assumption is the game was just expensive to make and couldnt fully realize their vision of a full complete story.   They left room for a sequel however so Im hoping this game gives them the funding and results they need to warrant making that sequel, however I cannot help but feel I did not receive the immersive story as it was not fully told. The game did leave some room for replayability so I still have a bit to get out of it but not much. But this game proves that the dev team is capable and competent so I hope that whatever they make next, a sequel or dlc, finishes the story and is bigger and better.  TLDR ; The basic mechanics are there and good, but set pieces need to be able to support those mechanics, story is not completely told and ends on a very odd spot, game is very short and leaves a lot to be desired, but I see what the devs are going for and I hope they can realize it in future projects. I would leave this game with a mixed rating if it existed but it does not therefore I will leave with a positive review as I did not encounter any bugs and the polish was there.",1

137908286,1294810,"I would be even more negative about this game if it had not come free with graphics card and I paid money.  Boy it's got issues.  Many I could overlook.  Like all good reviewers I'll share what I was looking for so you can decide for yourself if you'd feel the same.    I have a zombie slaying posse that plays Back 4 Blood regularly and for the most part really enjoy the ""jump in and kill a bunch of things together"" vibe of that.  Our collective hope was that we could go from ""zombies to vampires"" and keep it up.  Sadly that is not the case.    I'll mention first that if you watch the IGN review (gent with Aussie accent I believe) he sums up pretty much everything I didn't like about game.   But to summarize in my own words here's the negatives first:  - Boring gameplay marred with horrible enemy AI  - Multiplayer as of now only lets HOST progress.  This is where it diverges from B4B the most.  The nice thing about the B4B ""act"" structure was if you played through a level mid-act with friends hosting, it would be ""cleared"" for everyone (so even if you go back to solo play, etc, that level is now cleared at that difficulty).  In Redfall, potentially because of how they structured missions, etc. maybe that was just too difficult or they didn't think it through.  Not sure what to blame, I just know the game play is way too boring to keep going back to sections you've played through already with friends.  - Repetitive Use of Game Assets: I get that after dozens of hours in any game you'll see repeating textures, models, etc. but just in the intro tutorial level on the starting location (boat) you find the same ""dead girl in beige sweater"", in exact same pose numerous times.  And worse, you MEET her alive later when you clear the first ""home base"" as part of that same introductory level.   - You have to repeat the intro level for every character you want to swap out.  I have mixed feelings about making people replay from level 0 just to switch characters.  If it was more fun to replay maybe I wouldn't care so much - Mobility - stiff.  I'll give you an example:  Jumping over objects, like a guard rail in the road.  Most games give you more flexibility to do that at canted angles vs having to face the object you are vaulting straight on.  So this means if you are running parallel down a road with enemies ahead and you want to vault something to your left but still see the enemies, you have to turn 90 degrees and face the guard rail.  I feel like this is just poorly implemented.  Noticeably annoying.  - Sliding: you slide for days. Not horrible, just a bit longer than some other games I've played  So in summary, there's a lot to fix.  Lots of bugs (I'm hearing from review, I got too bored to find them myself) and bad AI.  Sadness.",0

137907755,1294810,"I received the $100 deluxe edition (whatever it's called) with my RTX 4080.  I was looking forward to the Redfall, given Arcane's history with Dishonored 1/2. Redfall is a bit disappointing, particularly when you consider its price-point.  TL;DR summary: Wait for a sale before buying. Maybe patches could improve some things. Seems like the developers were aiming for Borderlands with vampire, but they really missed the mark in terms of fun.  The AI is atrocious, I mean really bad. Most vampires don't do much other than swing at you and try to teleport behind you. Humans are dumb as well as you can take out most with headshots without others alerting.  The graphics are fine, it's not meant to be realistic, but there are more glitches than I would expect in a AAA title.  Audio is fine as well, nothing special here.  The environment looks good, again it's not meant to be realistic. Some of the locations are pretty neat.  The weapons are alright, nothing special here. There are a variety of weapons: at least 3 different kinds of pistols, a couple of types of flare guns, stake launchers, assault rifles of various types, shotguns, etc. Damage is based on the level of the weapon, weapon type and any inherent modifiers.  I haven't spent a lot of time with the skill tree as I am only level 6 or so. But I find that I don't need to use my abilities for much of anything, which is disappointing. Upgrading ammo capacity is definitely useful, but that's a passive ability.  I haven't experienced any performance issues so I can't comment there. My system is a Ryzen 7950X w/ 32GB of RAM, RTX 4080, etc. I put Redfall on my M.2 drive to get faster load times. For graphics settings, I set the resolution to 1440p 144Hz, enabled vsync, set DLSS to quality and left frame generation enabled (just to try it out). I get between 144 and 240fps and it's generally smooth.  I also haven't tried online mode, but I can't imagine things really improving with that.",0
137907108,1294810,"No true multiplayer, can only game with your current friends. No matchmaking. If someone leaves the party it terminates the session. Plus the game constantly crashes.",0
137906713,1294810,"Below was my reason for a refund statement, I stand by it:  I don't even know where to begin. A 30fps that dips when you do just about anything even on a computer that can run all other new games without issue is borderline offensive. The game is filled with glitches, it already crashed on me (ohh and the black screen counted as ""game-play"" time), it's so poorly optimized even though with the cartoon looking graphics one would think it wouldn't be so taxing to run. I cannot believe this comes from the same studio that produced Dishonored and Prey, a $70 price tag for this heap is offensive. So incredibly disappointed in Bethesda and Arkane. The game looks and feels completely unfinished, what is the point of a so-called open world game when one is able to interact with almost nothing? If this game were around thirty dollars I may not bother with a refund, but the price point for the impressively poor quality game is a travesty.

137908740,1566200,"TLDR; Super charming and simple hockey game that's well made! If you're new to hockey, haven't played a hockey game before, or love rogue-likes, you're in for a treat. If you're a veteran hockey game player you might not get as much mileage, but it's still enjoyable!  I'm going to preface this review with the fact that I'm a ""CHEL-er,"" so I know my way around a hockey game.   First and foremost, this plays really well, and made me grin from ear to ear with all its character and insanity. As an arcade style hockey game, this hits the right notes. I think the players move really well, and shooting is satisfying. Hitting is a bit on the 'eh' side, but the abilities and artefacts keep things wonky and interesting.  That being said, I just beat the campaign on my second run (humble brag alert). I realized I was playing on ""standard"" mode so I'll have to up the difficulty to put me in my place. I just feel like I've accomplished the full experience of what the game has to offer in 1.8 hours and I'm not super motivated to continue.  There's something about it that's holding me back from really loving it, and I think it's the simplicity of the game. I want to try and deke, I want to be able to have more control over the stick of my players (like using the skill stick in EA games)...but to add that feature in runs the risk of making the game too complicated, and that probably wouldn't hold true to the spirit of Tape to Tape, so I understand why it's not a part of it. I guess I just miss NHL Hitz.  Overall, I think if you're newer to hockey, or like arcade sports games, this is the perfect fit for you. I'm not so sure veterans of hockey games will have a ton to sink their teeth into, but I'm recommending this cause it's a very well made game with tons of personality and it's my own fault for subjecting myself to EA NHL as much as I have. Plus I know there's a huge untapped PC audience itching to get their hands on some hockey.",1

The best way I can describe it is, ""Cooperative FTL"". You and your crew need to make it through various challenges which can include decisions, random encounters, fights and boss fights.

It has a fairly stable build, I haven't experienced any issues yet. I will say the floor geometry is very exact, if it's too tall you'll have to find a way around unless you're underwater and have the upgraded suit. The knife does feel a bit short though, and timing is everything, and I do wish we had a way to 'holster' our knife so we can have a full unimpeded vision.

No. But honestly, how many games will? 3 bucks an hour is fine entertainment value for me, whether or not it is for you is gonna depend on your financial situation.  Swarm Grinder at least manages to differentiate itself in the genre by mixing up the main powerup loop by tying them to objectives rather than killing enemies, then makes killing enemies necessary to keep your mechs gas topped off to keep you alive.

137908790,1557990,"Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off- then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.  There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs- commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.  Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?- Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster- tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?  But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling And there they stand- miles of them- leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets avenues- north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?  Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries- stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.  But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies- what is the one charm wanting?- Water- there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.  Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick- grow quarrelsome- don’t sleep of nights- do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;- no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,- though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board- yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;- though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids.  No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the fore-castle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time.  What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain’t a slave? Tell me that.",1

137911495,1294810,"TLDR: If you’re looking for reasons you need to play this game … there isn’t much to tell you. The most impressive thing about Redfall is how uninspired every part of it feels to play.   The graphics make it look like a late 2000s game, which I could live with if not for the fact that it is obscenely demanding even on top tier current gen hardware. Normally this is where one might place the blame on it being a port. That is a flimsy excuse here, as Arkane is owned by Bethesda which in turn is owned by Microsoft, and Redfall is an Xbox exclusive. Gameplay videos from Xbox do not look much better either. They only needed this to run well on their own operating systems, and they failed even at that!  Paul Tassi in his Redfall [url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/05/04/redfall-review-xbox-series-x-something-terrible-happened-here/?sh=7b3dc72c418a] review [/url] wrote: “In a sea of famous video game disasters over the last few years… I am genuinely unsure I’ve seen a game this bad.” He hits many of the other main notes, chiefly that the AI is atrocious, the core gameplay is dissatisfying (assuming it even works), the social implementation is a disaster (host progression only, and no matchmaking), etc. There is no shortage of scornful reviews, and frankly Redfall deserves nearly all of it.  Personally, I would like to know when corporate management/ownership will stop treating developers and players alike with undisguised contempt. It is insane to me that Microsoft/Bethesda/whomever had Arkane, of all people, make this game. It reminds me of when EA had Bioware make Anthem. Taking a studio that does a certain aspect of video gaming exquisitely well (level design, consequentialism, and stealth; narrative, and character design, respectively) and throwing them at whatever Big Thing has seduced the corporate executives.  Phil Spencer, Chief Xbox Guy himself, apologized for Redfall’s appalling launch. He tried claiming “They didn’t hit their own internal goals when it launched.” I don’t buy it for a second. Even if they didn’t know the specifics, how could they not know they had a mess on their hands? They pushed it out anyway to cash in on us. The blame and shame rightly belong with Microsoft more than anything else.  Bottom line: publishers need to stop bullying the little companies they’ve swallowed into making profit-chasing garbage far outside their strengths at the expense of everything else. Since they aren’t about to do that out of the goodness of their hearts, we need to demand it. Vote with your wallets. Do not buy this game.",0
137910078,1294810,"Big fan of Arkane games, lots of playtime in Dishonored, Prey, & Deathloop.  Bought this game on blind faith in Arkane. Never again.   Don't think I've ever really regreted a game purchase or lost interest so quickly before.  Hopefully the feedback on this product is a wake up call to Arkane and they produce quality immersive sims in the future.",0

137912273,1155330,"In lack of a neutral score option I will give this a thumbs down.  If there was a way to skip walking around the overworld it would get a thumbs up. This layer does not add anything to the game, except for a chore. I will give it a second chance today, but I think this might end up being one of those buys I regret a bit too late.  That is really sad, as I love the core game here. Good turn based combat mechanics, better than a lot of the competition. It's just the annoying walking around I didn't sign up for. Why o why did they make it so? I am guessing they even spent a lot of time on making it a worse game? Who decided that was a good idea?  If they could add an option to just have the combat and skip all that walking stuff it would get an instant thumbs up from me.",0

137911676,1669000,"The race selection is terrible: you basically have 6 factions with 6 units each. Not _unique_ units, mind you: shieldbearers, pikemen, archers and priests are pretty much the same no matter what side you're playing as. Although some factions give them a single perk. Once you choose a faction, you'll slap 4 perks on top of it - two physiological, two cultural. You can also choose a skin, but elves have no functional difference from toads. And that's it, you're done.  Everything else comes from tomes of magic, where you can study whatever you like. Necromancy, holy magic, chaos, nature - whatever, it's all up for grabs. You may very well end up with nonsense like ""Zealous Frostling Steelskin Demonic Elves"" - the game doesn't care at all.   If you play long enough, you'll have angels, demons and undead marching in the same army with no penalties.  Thematically, the game is a mess.  Oh, and AI is kinda helpless too. It combat, it doesn't understand that it's better to wait in an advantageous position than to rush down the bottleneck. And on global scale It can't defend itself against raids, and does some really dumb things like sending you an insult and then paying you so you would forgive that insult.   I have a lot of gripes with this game, but I'm still upvoting it, because at the end of the day it's still kinda fun to build up your empire and steamroll your enemies with hordes of expendable archers that are automatically magicked up to their gills. Oh, and different map settings actually make for noticeable differences in gameplay, which also extends AoW4's lifecycle.",1

137912218,1494420,"First, I know that this is an early access game.  That being said, I was not able to play this game simply because I could not set my own controls.  I do not play with WASD, and there was (as of yet) no option for players to set their own controls.  Graphically, the game appears to be decent.  I also did not notice a melee option.  I see a lot of promise, but, at this moment I would not recommend this game.  It is also not clear to me how many players can be on one server.  I'm hoping for something close to Planetside 2, which is 2000 (yes, two thousand) players on a single map.",0
137912008,1494420,"Definitely in a beta state, but it's off to a great start. This game reminds me of Star Craft and a little bit of Star Citizen in terms of scenery. The combat is great with tracers flying around everywhere as a swarm approaches. The vehicle combat is pretty good. It was fun when another player with a rocket launcher jumped into the bed of my heavy quad (A humvee with a Gatling gun) and we went full Mad Max.  I think the bugs are a under powered especially in the later stage of the match when the humans have better tanks and rockets. But it also depends on who is commanding and how many players there are on the bug team. With a competent commander producing swarms, it can be challenging for the humans. Especially if a Goliath sneaks around and starts attacking important structures.   A lot of attention to UI is needed for the commander position. I can be difficult to find certain units when they're all bunched up, and difficult to find units who wondered off. For infantry it would be nice to have a squad system, or be able to identify who is a player. The pathfinding for the harvesters is janky, they often get caught on buildings.  I'm sure balancing, better UI, and new units will come in future updates. Hopefully they release a roadmap sometime soon. Overall I'm excited to see where this game goes and I don't regret spending $20 on it.",1

The game lacks basic features like key rebinding, identifiers for your teammates on the HUD, or any kind of tools to coordinate with your team like a ping system. I get that it's early access but this is too barebones and basic.  It's a tech demo or proof of concept.",0

With the game only being 20 us dollars i say for the price its a steal bc i could see this game going for like 40 us dollars while in EA and a easy full price when done if it holds the same quality it has now in the finished game. 10/10 keep going and your have a series here for a while to come.",1

137911182,1494420,"Okay, before I start with the things I love about this game I will go over some of the problems:  The balance is wack, aliens can feel almost unstoppable at times, especially scorpions being able to shoot from practically safety. There are other times where the aliens get dominated. Early game aliens is powerful and late game humans is just ridiculous.  Infantry is practically useless late game when they should really still be relevant, i mean most aliens can one shot the best infantry costing a whole 500 resources, they just aren't cost effective.  The pathfinding is atrocious at times, but not really for the combat units, but the Harvesters in specific. Even after this last update they still get stuck frequently and sometimes the commander has to focus on their Harvesters leaving the rest of the players to scramble a defense against an Alien army that probably has Goliaths already.  Now for the good:  This game is a blast to play in multiplayer, each game feels different where terrain can make massive differences in the strategies for either team, bugs with terrain can practically entrench themselves allowing for great defensive plays, while flat terrain is where humans do best.   The battles are frankly epic, I had a match where the bugs were using these large cliffs to fire at us from above, while we slowly made progress with artillery and railguns, eventually breaking their defense and taking out there rather open base.  The RTS and First Person Shooter is fused wonderfully, there are times where I completely forget that this game is an RTS simply from how units move around and react to one another, the range of the fights is also staggering, where railguns and scorpions have incredible ranges where no RTS would usually go.",1
137911127,1494420,Commander/RTS issues: Typing into team/global chat rotates the map while typing. Building upgrades sometimes get bugged out and do not allow you to upgrade. [Will update when more issues or bugs are found.]  Soldier/FPS Issues: N/A  At the moment I don't have anything to say about the FPS side of things since I have only played a little over an hour as a Commander.

Perhaps this would be alleviated with some of the upgrades that you can get which deal with the clouds and the water, but again leveling up is just too much of a hassle for the limited amount of upgrades I do get to even matter.  The game also does seem to get repetitive at times, which is not helped by the fact that I keep on dying at the first level like an absolute loser. The grind just isn't for me it seems.  Maybe I am just terrible at this game. However, I have played other games in which I absolutely sucked that, at the very least, poked me in just the right way for me to keep on trying and dying.

Don't like the dumb little weirdos that chase you around in chapter 2, could do without all of that. Disappointed because I had a lot of fun with the spontaneous hiding and chasing and new designs that would show up when caught by the teacher from the first playtest/demo.

137910397,1824960,"Whenever I play a VR game I always ask myself would this be a good game if it wasn't VR? Propagation: Paradise Hotel would absolutely have been a great game even with the VR components removed. It is essentially, a very, very competent love letter to Resident Evil. The game looks fantastic, the VR implementation is great, the combat is surprisingly tense (for someone who has played many survival horror games) and the final boss fight is top tier.  The games major failing is the ending. To sum the ending up in one word I would say: ""pathetic"". We are talking sopranos level bad. Mass Effect 3 on launch level bad. Lost level bad.  Some other reviews have said that it was probably cut short and unfinished after the devs ran out of time and money, but honestly, I think it was done on purpose. The game has a short and sweet campaign, which is fine, but all that was required to bring the story to some kind of conclusion would be another human 3D model, a helicopter model and the absolutely minimum of scripting.  I have no idea how the whole dev team sat in the room with the person who suggested that ending without calling them a single celled neuronally challenged imbecile.  I would have honestly considered this game to be a masterpiece, not only as a VR game, but as a survival horror game. With an ending that bad however, I give it a solid: meh/10.  I recommend this game only for people that want to experience a true survival horror/RE1 clone in VR, that are ok with a short playtime and no conclusion to the game.",1

UI is attractive and clean; and penny (player character) is wonderfully ditsy in the most understandable and relatable way. Quite a few mini games, each one creating a source of inspiration for your plot relative progression item, and usually introducing a cute new character. load times are surprisingly long for a Visual Novel style game.

Writing is enjoyable and there are some pretty good jokes abound, Although some lines, specifically the ones in dream sequences, come off as kinda cringey, it is clear there is attention to having characters be memorable through speech patterns and not only design.  I am glad to see that nearly every ending for penny is pleasant in some way, leading to her happiness even if it may begin as unfortunate for her.

137912591,1742020,"Things in this game that work: - References to Hololive talent and culture in general. It's very clear that this is a project made with a lot of love, which gives the game a lot of charm. - Animations. Beautiful pixel art and effects give each round a very vibrant feel. - Sound design. The voice lines and music remixes give this game way more polish than it has any right to have. - Balance between depth and newcomer friendliness. I was skeptical of the special button, but it won me over quickly as a good way to help bridge the gap between new and veteran fighting game players.  Nitpicks/suggestions: - Suisei feels undertuned in terms of frame data. She doesn't need to be a Melty Blood character, but her attacks need either more range or slightly less lag if she's going to be able to compete in the same game as the current top tiers (Botan, Sora, Korone). - Burst feels very polarizing. Certain characters get punished significantly harder by having their combo ended than others (cough, Botan). - Korone straight up needs more lag. 1/2 additional frames per attack would help bring her in line without ruining her. - Botan's damage should be brought more in line. As it currently sits, her potential damage per combo is too high for how safe her gameplan is. - Collabs feel clunky, but the system itself is a very interesting take on the traditional assist system.  Overall, for a free fan-made game, there isn't a lot to actually complain about for Idol Showdown. I'm excited to see this game continue to receive updates as the devs seem very in tune with the community. It isn't a perfect package, but any serious balance issues that arise can always be patched later. The systems largely work as intended, and the polish in the package is worth well above the price of admission.  Grade: B+",1

137914367,1294810,"[h1] To those who are truly reading through the reviews: [/h1]  From my observations, this game received a harsh review bomb, and everyone else jumped on the band wagon. Now, let's get into the review.   [olist] [*] [b][u] VISUALS [/u][/b] I have been playing for almost 13 hours and have had minimal frame lag or issues with the frames; I run primarily quality settings and average around 100 frames according to my AMD software. Most who experience issues might either leave settings on default (which includes super resolutions) or need to dial the settings in correctly. I would give this game's art style and visual effects an 8.5/10. There is work to smooth it out however, it is very pleasing already.   [*] [b][u] STORY [/u][/b] This story-line has you running all over the place and often puts you in a bind between two fighting factions, vampires, special vampires, and then a Rook all at once. On nightmare difficulty, I have to try not to die; later in the game, it gets more challenging; I consider the initial map a super long tutorial. The plot line of the story is simplistic. However, it is interesting as it is not your run-of-the-mill and keeps you busy. There are a few areas where it takes a dark turn, and I applaud the story developers for being willing to take the game to those darker areas. For story I give it a 7.5/10.   [*] [b][u] GAMEPLAY [/u][/b] Yes, the beginning is rather long and could be treated as a tutorial; the game feels similar to Dishonored, and the hit registry works beautifully; for solo play, this game is worth the time a player will put into it. For multiplayer, once they fix the issue of character progression (not story), the co-op will be worth it. A buddy and I played a few times, and even though we sometimes couldn't save character gear and leveling, we still joined and played together. The best part is I am stationed in Japan while he is in the US...if we can play together, you can too. Overall, it is a whimsical vampire slaying game with some decent ideas and mechanics. I score it at 6/10, with the only thing holding it back is the co-op progression issues. I will update the review in two months.  [/olist]  [h1] [b][u] CONCLUSION [/u][/b] [/h1]  I have had more issues with the latest CODs, including Warzone & BLOPS4; I have had more issues with Dying Light 2, Elden Ring, and others. All of which could be mitigated by tweaking settings. The initial wave of people who tried this game did not keep an open mind and went into it thinking it would not work. Hence, no effort was put into making it work. While I agree a game should come ready to play when released, I don't think that is a fair assumption to have in the gaming community anymore, as we all do not account for the extra work that goes into making the games for multiple different platforms and trying to use the same mold.   I have a great analogy for it: picture a road; in this instance, the road is the game. Now put one person in a semi-truck with all 18 gears and manual transmission, one in a forklift, and one on a generic 4-door sedan. All vehicles would need to use the road and would drive the same, especially, but to get them to drive is another story: different controls, different speeds, and different training. The vehicles are your hardware pieces. Eventually, things will smooth out as we learn; however, the launch is expected to be rocky.",1
137913077,1294810,this is a pretty great game the graphics and climbing mechanic can be a little better but i just beat it and i enjoyed it. dont listen to everyone its fun 13.5 to beat maybe should be 39.99 tho.,1
137912579,1294810,"This is game makes me hesitant to get anything else Arkane has its name on. Cyberpunk was trashed because of the bugs and glitches but this games makes it look like a polished diamond. Between the boss enemies/items not spawning so missions cant be completed to the mobs textures not loading so you get killed by random particle effects or the hit box not being over the textures so you cant deal damage the game is unplayable, or massively too easy when the path finding locks enemies behind a bench or they just never see you're there and don't react to the damage. Scaling is way off for the loot which feels very limited in verity, it feels like the start of a good game that has a lot of work left to be put into it and should still be in alpha.",0
137914911,1155330,One of the best turn based games I've play in a while. Would highly recommend. If you can tell not the best when it comes to reviews.,1

So far in 2023 this seems to be a rarity that must be celebrated.",1

137914833,1669000,Great game! Fantasy Civ. With more awesome features.,1
137914622,1669000,"The pacing of the game seems greatly improved from AoW 3 and Planetfall. There is also a lot more flexibility in playstyle and character/faction options which I really appreciate. The combat moves smoothly and the auto complete is robust, letting you see results play out if you would like a visual of how the AI got certain results. Empire building and resource management hits the fine balance between complexity and not being too cumbersome. The meta game seems a little token compared to works like Thea, but I am glad it is there as it is a nice way to connect the separate games together, which has always been a weakness of the series for me.   Also, unicorns fart out rainbows as they move.",1

137914128,2272420,"I really like this game.  It features a lot of mechanics that make the game fun, like learning the routines of residents, marking cameras, lockpicking and more.  The game features many different ways to steal, like robbing houses, robbing industrial facilities, pickpocketing, hacking ATMs, finding parcel codes, etc.  There is a story, but you can also do a lot of side missions or just rob any place you want.  At your home (the hideout), there is a PC where you can buy tools like a crowbar, lockpicks and night-vision goggles, accept side missions, buy tips for the places you rob, sell stolen stuff on BlackBay (the black market), upgrade your drones, and customize your equipment.  All of this makes it very diversified; it never gets boring because there are so many different things you can do.  It does have some issues, like minor bugs/glitches, some things render very late, some objects don't have collision and the road markings don't connect properly in some spots.  Keep in mind that this is not the full game yet, MrCiastku is constantly improving the game and posting updates about it in the Discord.  The full game will feature way more content, things like a full story, heists (a bank robbery), lots of new places to rob, sports cars, many new abilities, improved police behavior and improved graphics.  Overall it's really fun and unique, I recommend it.",1

137913058,1566200,"I really, really want to like this game. It takes a lot of aspects from games like NHL Hitz and Super Blood Hockey, but fails to be a satisfying experience. I get that it is a run based game and as such is subject to a bunch of modifiers in order to make the game different from run to run, but it utterly fails in this way because the abilities are A. way too OP, B. Not so much powers as much as the other team just straight up cheating, and C. Not consistently enough offered to the player as a way to even the odds a little. I have a lot of powers and superstars unlocked to give your runs a better chance at success, but 98% of the time I am only offered the starting three powers and superstars to choose from. The players AI is abysmal, you actually need a perk in order for a DEFENSEMAN to play DEFENSE! The goalie more often than not passes it to either nobody or the other team, and is responsible for over 50% of the goals against. Poke checking feels bad, body checking feels bad. The first boss of the game is quite literally a team that blatantly cheats. I want to just let the record show that I HAVE beaten these bosses, all the way to the golfers (haven't beaten them quite yet) but I feel like this game goes about difficulty all wrong. Just make the players better at hockey, don't make them cheat more and more in order to win games! Even when you do beat these teams, it just doesn't feel good because the game feels unfair win or lose. I don't need a whole team that farts and blasts pucks and players away, or plays the game on grass instead of ice (how would this idea ever be fun?!) just make them be better at hockey.",0

137914442,1494420,"This game is a rare gem - It has a TON of potential and I look forward to dedicated servers (preferably Linux-based DS software, please) so I can host SEVERAL servers for this game for my group and the public.  If you enjoyed Command and Conquer Renegades and Starcraft/Starship troopers you will LOVE this game.  The RTS aspect feels just like an RTS game - really feels like command and conquer.  The FPS aspect feels like an actual FPS game.  They have been meshed together in the same game at a masterful level.",1

137914179,1494420,"[i]This is an early access game. Please understand that when purchasing this game. Silica currently has one Dev name Dram who is responsive and has suggestions/Q&A forums on discord which you can find on the store page.[/i]  That being said~ I've only really played Strategy, as Arena is an oldschool FPS deathmatch, and Prospector is a base tutorial.  [h1]This game (even at it's current early access state) is gold, a gem, literal Baltarium for the RTS/FPS genre.[/h1]  It gives me PS2 Battlefront, Halo 1, Battlefield, and Broodwar nostalgia vibes.  Silica's setting makes you think of the plot of Starship Troopers set on the Planet Arrakis from Dune with some very imaginative takes on futuristic and alien weaponry.  [b]This is the type of game AAA studios should be courageous enough these days to develop themselves but won't. [/b]  [b]There is so much depth to the game that's hidden until you play it as both a Commander(RTS) and Infantry (FPS).[/b]   There's no bullet damage drop off and you have infinite range~ the only limitation is terrain that gets in the way.  You have day and night cycles that create scenario's that dramatically decrease vision, forcing you to use thermals/bug night vision. Bright lights can be seen across the map at night, giving away your position and type to enemy infantry who can report that to their commander, and even shoot you across the map if they're a good shot.  Dunes and rock outcroppings become strategic in combat defensively and offensively for infantry to use as firing cover and commanders to build near to protect buildings.  [h1] Imagine being first person in a SC size deathball v deathball [/h1] The firefights are a light show (especially at night). Every vehicle/alien/infantry has a unique projectile or ability.   Seeing a swarm approach you as a Commander is one thing, but as an Infantry it really is an ""oh shit"" moment and you rush to the barracks for the rocket launcher with infinite ammo and use the barrack's teleport to get to the frontlines.  Popping out of the ground as a crab to attack to a siege tank and cause the Humans to friendly fire on it with rockets/artillery or mowing down light armored vehicles as a scorpion, or rolling to dodge a siege tank shot as this massive goliath looking to decimate enemy infrastructure.  You can drive/be everything in this game~ Even the drones are farming simulator you can do if you don't like FPS or RTS, you can sit around and collect resources all day for your Comm( sometimes you gotta get out of your 3 story high truck and shoot a bug crawling on it).  The game is playable, the core functions are there with more features already in the files ([url=https://youtu.be/xfORyMin1r8?t=37] flying vehicles [/url]). The RTS strategy is there, the FPS skill ceiling is there. It's got nowhere to go but up.   [h1] However.. [/h1]  There are still issues with lag because there is no unit limit, (you can tell when theres 100+ crabs/rifleman in one spot) and you start getting a little desync.  There are no dedicated servers, and the auto new-match doesn't work after a game completes; you have to rejoin the server if you're not the host.  You can meta game pretty hard by swapping teams at the start to see where the enemy spawned.  AI is very limited; shrimp getting stuck in quartz, harvesters being what you imagined a first timer would do to completed a three-point turn, behemoths and ranged AI will attempt to charge into melee when they're ranged, or heavy ordinance blatantly shooting missiles at your harvester with a single crab on it.  There are no hotkeys for Commander, and you must select your main base (HQ or Nest) every time you want to build.  There's no FF for the commander available, and if the server host leaves the game ends for everyone.  [h1] All of which are things that come with the Early Access tag, but at a steal of 15 USD price tag (25 at launch). [/h1]  TL:DR; You like living forever, feeding the swarm, being a man who rides shrimp? Crab People and EDM light shows of death with explosions? Worth every penny.",1

137913462,1494420,Multiplayer wouldn't connect no matter how much I tried. The aliens were flying around as if there was zero gravity making it seem just goofy. Overall a pretty game but feels very very early access. I would wait for it to cook more. Only reason for low play time is after tootling around for a few minutes in singleplayer then I spent a while trying to connect to multi but nothing would connect and thanks to steam's refund rules I wasn't going to risk going over the refund timer trying to troubleshoot since I have zero problems with any other of my 400+ games internet wise.,0
137915089,2337630,Even tough there is glitches the game is still very fun to play.,1

Making tea, picking fruits from the trees, elders telling stories of local history, running around a village where everybody knows you... I love foraging and learning about the plants. The painting mechanic is neat, and I look forward to the full puzzle-y version depicted above. I don't know if it's actually possible to complete the final demo quest, since you can only gather 3 pieces of manure each day, and it requires 20. Felt sad when the demo ended, both because of the unfinished quest and because I was just starting to add furniture to the tea shop and getting attached. Looking forward to the full thing!",1

Nabnab is pritty mysterious, but he aint got nothing on Jumbo Josh.  The puzzles take a long time to solve. Somtimes I get mad and want to quit, but then if you think hard enough it comes to you. The game is hard but cool. When you solve a puzzle you feel like you really did something.  Pictures in the game are very pretty. Banban garden looks very cool and Nabnab's lair is very dark but coool too. You can see all the pretty flowers and things. Even the characters are cool looking, like they are in a cartoon.  In the end, Garten of Banban is a very fun video game. If you like Banban, then you will like this too. Jumbo Josh and his gangsta-ness add a cool factor to the game that is hard to resist.

137917325,1294810,"i know that this review will probably be lost in between other reviews, but i wanted to voice my opinion  this game is not worth the 70$ it is at the very best 20-30$ as the game is really short, not a lot of story or areas to explore, you have to restart the game to be able to get to a decent level with nothing else to do at the end of it",0
137917076,1294810,"Extremely mediocre game. Overpriced. Generic NPCs, dumb AI, bad lightning at some shadow setting. Still pictures with cheam animations. Female priest with a white collar and tattoos. Yeah sure it isn't a woke provocation. Not at all..... The atmosphere sometimes is really good but then... https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972469190 Also some vampires are bugged. They stand or float still and talk but do not attack. All in all it really feels like a cash & grab. (Phil Spencer's apology means nothing.) +1 You can't join to a random host, only to a friend.",0
137915876,1294810,"The good:  The game is a ton of fun, provided you manage your expectations. This isn't GOTY material by any means, but I am thoroughly enjoying my time with the game playing solo.  It performs decent on my system, traversal stutter notwithstanding. Your mileage *will* vary.  The story is intriguing, but nothing amazing yet.  The gunplay feels great once you get the controls tweaked. I play with a controller and the default response curve is dreadful. Definitely set it to low and bump your sensitivity to 3.25+ if you're playing with a gamepad.   The middling:  The visuals can look really good in some aspects, and really poor in others. I like the stylized art style they went with here. There can be a ton of little details in some areas, but then some woefully empty locations by contrast.  Not a lot to the game yet. Seems like it maybe needed another six months to flesh out the content.  Cutscenes are pretty low budget. Basically still dioramas with spoken dialogue. Good enough for the kind of game they made I suppose, but for the asking price these leave a lot to be desired.  The multiplayer centric focus ultimately works against the game as a whole. I would have enjoyed this far better had it been a more typical immersive sim from Arkane. I can't confirm as I haven't played co-op by myself, but it sounds like only the host actually progresses when playing co-op which is not great in my opinion.   The bad:  The AI, for real.   A lot of the time, enemies can't even hit you at close range and their reaction time is hilariously slow between the time they've spotted you to when they start to engage. Then sometimes you'll get absolutely stomped by a group that seems to have the difficulty knob cranked to 11. The balance needs to be tweaked considerably to have it be more even across the board.   Limited stealth options despite the game encouraging it via tutorials. No stealth kill animations either. Just sneak up behind someone and elbow them in the b-hole.   Overall, in it's current state I'd give it a solid 6/10 despite the amount of fun I'm having with it. If they can patch it into shape and get some more content in here, it could eventually become something worthy of a higher score. Wait for a sale.",1
137914962,1155330,"[h1]Will this game be worth your time?[/h1]  If you enjoy these kinds of turn based tactics game, you will have some fun with this game. [b]BUT[/b] for veterans of the gerne, this game will not be challenging. If you've played any XCOM LW or Phoenix Point for a decent amount of hours, this game will likely be very easy for you and you will find the lack of costumization or strategic build options frustrating. [hr][/hr] Let me preface my review by saying that I am a reasonably experienced tactical strategy game player (combined about 1800 hours in XCOM, XCOM LW, Phoenix Point) and went blind into the hard difficulty. I finished the game with completing and finding everything there is in about 17 hours. I took my time, searched every corner, looked for ways to maximise synergies and such. So yes, this game is very short. I'd say it's too short. The story builds up to an antagonist which you will defeat in a very anticlimactic battle and then [spoilers]another mission to defeat the host[/spoiler]. All of this feels like a tutorial for a bigger part, as the game also walks you through all the ins and outs bit by bit. I was ready to dive deep into some harder missions now that I've had all six of your soldiers in battle at the same time and [spoilers]killed both antagonists[/spoilers]. Well, the game is over. [b]Sadly, this game offers little to no replayabilty value[/b] once you have been through the ~12 hours of content. It is more like XCOM Chimera Squad than an actual campaign, blink and you've missed it. Just like XCOM:CS, it's short, you got almost no customization options (even fewer in fact) but it's a fun and entertaining short while. If you enjoyed Chimera Squad, you'll enjoy Showgunners. [hr][/hr] [h1]What's good and what is not?[/h1] + amazing soundtrack and sound design in general. VO is good. + great quality of life. The devs really value your time and don't make you jump through hoops multiple times. Also, there's a speed up enemy combat button. Take notes, Firaxis. + game runs smoothly on ultrawide and has all the necessary audio/video settings. Take notes, Firaxis. + all the characters and enemies feel different, the story is okay, but short. + the game has many of the good mechanics of the genre and almost none of the bad. The battles feel clear and laid out, the rules are consistent and easy.  - game is too easy. The puzzles are mostly done well but nothing to ponder. The traps are more annoyance than hinderance, they really don't add much to the game. The battles are self contained, short and mostly interchangable. The maps are all presets, but most lack any special features. The only somewhat challanging battle is the very last one but even that is a lot softer than most other games of the genre. - balance. The balance is off. Quite early on, you'll get a teammate that could theoretically solve all but the bossfights for you by himself - given you're patient enough. The power gap between [spoiler]Tybalt, who can solo most encounters, and Warden, who is a clunky piece of metal[/spoiler] (certain characters) is so huge that the game makes most decisions on who to pick for a scenario for you. - Almost no customization options. All characters will learn all the skills from their skilltree eventually, the available weapons offer no meaningful difference (one exception) and the equipment is whatever. - the ""traps"" during exploration are repetitive and annoying. They are too harmless to matter and too common to ignore. The whole exploration layer feels a bit tedious and doen't add much to the game at all. - the game is completely linear. Literally. It has a beginning and an end and curates every step in between, there's no decision making at all in the player agency. [hr][/hr] I still recommend this game and here is what you get:  You're playing as an assault type close combat character and the others all have different profiles. Stealthy hacker type guy, a huge but immobile pile of HP, classic support grenadier, sniper for big single target numbers and a big heavy with a large gun and some aoe. All different, all fun, nothing too fancy. You will have seen most skills and abilities in other games. Before every mission (short ambushes excluded), you'll choose who to bring on your 2 to 4 man team and off you go: small maps, quick combats, most only last a few rounds.  The game rewards clever play by giving more fame, but that's not really an issue. By playing even a little smart, you'll have ~180k fame by the end of the game. The max required for a benefit is 125k. Still, it's a nice thing to see all those pentakills give you something extra. Btw, the game does not count further than five. Six and more kills in a round only display as too many kills.   Just as most other games of this genre, Showgunners encourages you to hinder enemies from acting or force them to skip their turn. Two characters do that a lot (and I mean A LOT) better than the others. Bringing them on every mission is what makes this game too easy.  The setting is cyberpunk dystopia, which you'll have seen dozens of in the last few years. If it wasn't for zombie apocalyptic stuff everywhere, this'd be the most overdone setting in recent years - it's fine though. Throughout the story, you'll learn the protagonist's motivations and backstory and why you want the antagonist dead. It's cliché, but well, this game isn't about the story. It's good enough to give context for the battles.  You'll have some side missions, a bit of exploration, puzzle solving and a few traps to avoid - and voila, you sank 12 hours into a fun little tactical strategy game. [hr][/hr] I'm hoping for a sequel with more to do or at least a really hard mode where every ambush could potentially be lethal and isn't just a mild inconvenience on your way to the story mission. Smarter enemies, more (and more creative) environmental hazards and more punishing enemy abilites would go a long way for Showgunners. Right now, it's a snacksized squad tactics game that will tickle your XCOM itch without starting a whole new campaign again. Just like Chimera Squad was.  [h1]Now go, buy it.[/h1]",1
137917832,1669000,"Much more fun than Age of Wonders III, a little light on options, but let's be honest, it's the very beginning. We'll see where it goes!",1
137917748,1669000,"Into my second game and don't want to put this down.

137917371,1669000,"Every race is just a skin now, so the flavor of the game has been reduced to a handful of boring units that can look a little different. Pretty bummed because I loved Planetfall, but this feels too basic. I noticed my enemy had some crazy items, but with no shop, I'm assuming everything is from loot or rewards which I'm not interested in. This game is supposed to be about building the ideal empire, but if equipment is random, I'm out.",0
137917131,1669000,"Considering all the 2023 launched games to date, I was afraid of picking this one up.

137917115,1669000,Can't get enough of this!!,1
137917049,1669000,"Frustrating and broken system.   World spawns increase in tier as the game progresses.  Right when you think you are strong enough to go after the monster guarding a treasure, think again, it's now morphed into a mob twice as strong.   NO stacking your units.   Each hero can only hold 5 units.  Overall game feels tedious.  I had a Heroes itch, and this definitely did not scratch it.",0

137917012,1669000,"I'm not used to games launching in a good state, especially not 4X games. This is a tremendous foundation to what will clearly be a long-running game. Worthy sequel to AOW3. One of the best UIs in the genre.Everything from the units to the city development to the magic just WORKS.",1
137916518,2272420,"Although this game has the ""Thief Simulator"" title, it's not necessarily the same game, as Noble Muffins, the creator of Thief Simulator, would instead work on American Theft 80s instead.  They even released a DLC for Thief Simulator a short while back.  For a proof of concept, it carries over several of the basic ideas of the original games, but it doesn't improve them nor even feature them in this prologue (dogs are mentioned but not shown), and also creates a litany of technical problems.  The original Thief Simulator had some jank, but characters would typically follow scripted events and arrive & leave at specific intervals during the day.  In this one, people will be predisposed to certain times, but occasionally leave earlier than usual (and shrink out of existence once they leave their designated location), or never deviate from a certain spot.  Cosmetics are all over place; both Thief Simulator and American Theft 80s decided to invoke a stereotypical American neighborhood motif, but this game has assets all over the place; the houses have the look of suburban America, but there are British kilometre signs, German license plates, and Australian storage boxes. The demo also has a difficulty balance issue where, and this is just mild spoilers, but once you buy one item in the itinerary, money will no longer be an issue.  I worry that the final version will just make it so that item will be ultra expensive, which will make getting it pointless for a different reason.  There's also the fact that it doesn't support controller input; you're required to use a keyboard and mouse.  I assume this will be in the final version, but if not, it's going to be a big detriment to playing this game.  I can tolerate jank and I can even see the fun in that, but I can't tolerate not having controller support.",0

137917069,1566200,"very fun game, mucho enjoy",1
137916673,1566200,"This game is a gem. Plays great on the Deck and hitting goals is incredibly satisfying. There's a lot of tactical consideration in team composition - I find myself using the speedy weak superstar to get up the rink and then pass it to McShaggy or one of my wings for a goal from the other side.  Echo some of the sentiments here - difficulty's a bit out of wack at the moment. Normal is frustrating difficult and your players move like they're in mud, Easy difficulty feels great though and like an adequate challenge.   The opposing team's style and gimmicks are fun as well, though some can be frustrating. Does change the tactics up a bit.  I will say even on Easy the chance of hitting a goal seems kind of random and primarily stat driven. I do find myself hitting more goals when I pass into it from the other side of the field but even then it seems random whether the goalie stops it or not.  Overall, fantastic game so far and loving it. Just needs some tightening up.",1
137916658,1566200,"Interesting game, it's an arcade style hockey game, with rogue-like elements. Can't say I've played anything quite like it.  The gameplay itself is pretty fun, and the fact that the runs can differ between playthroughs means that this has the potential to be endlessly replayable.   For now however, the game is going though some growing pains with rogue-like elements being a point of frustration (You often get limited on how often you can select your unlockables for example, so buying new ones just adds to the pool and means you're less likely to get the item to begin with), but the developers seem to be actively monitoring and trying to come up with a solution to this issue.  For a game in Early Access, it's exactly in the state I'd expect it to be from a small team, and I'll be following the development of the game closely going forward, and am excited to see where it goes.",1

Their goalie is insane while yours is trash, not to mention they literally cheat. You're playing against the officials so they win every face off, they have an extra player as a result of the game official essentially being on their team, they count non-goals as goals and then when you finally take the lead, they don't count your point. Sorry, it was just way too many ""Quirky"" gimmicks all at once for my taste. I played up to that boss like 6 times and finally scored on them in OT but they miraculously didn't count the goal.

137916022,1494420,"Pretty cool game with some drawbacks. The bad first:  Early game is pretty boring for everyone who isn't the commander as your running around a lot of empty terrain just to scout.   You are not told a lot. Best way to learn is to spend a couple matches as the commander  Its buggy of course   Game-play mechanics could be polished up but every unit does its job well enough for the moment  Requires coordination with teammates  The Good:  Basically when you have a group that is coordinating well, its just an awesome experience commander or on the ground. Really enjoyed playing as commander asking the front line what they needed and sending the relevant  equipment to back them up. Nothing like being a part of a tank battalion as siege covers your advance on the enemy base.  The communication and coordination between on the ground forces and the commander is just really cool.  All in all I hope this game continues to be worked on. Its a really unique experience that should be advanced.",1

137915600,1840790,"This game has a lot of good ideas, but it's not quite where it needs to be. It pains me to give this game a thumbs down. I really don't want to, but I must. You should consider this if and only if you are into indie roguelites like Curse of the Dead Gods, which I think is the closest comparison to this game. I beat it on my third run, and there are some things I enjoy and some things that need a LOT of work.  Ignore the reviews saying the combat is clunky/slow. It's not - it's intentional in the same way that Dark Souls and CotDG are. You need to manage your spacing and attack commitment to do well. Unfortunately, that also means that combat often boils down to finding a somewhat ranged attack and spamming it to stunlock enemies.   The good: you have a lot of combat options which each get their own elemental upgrade options, like your normal attack, weapon skill, boss transformation, valkyrie transformation, dodge, and parrying doesn't upgrade but all the rest do. The animations are flashy and combat looks cool. There are elemental fusions, akin to Hades duo boon upgrades, which are awesome. The metaprogression is meaningful and makes you stronger in between runs. As you pass through the 4 stages, the game gets progressively difficult. Upgrades that directly affect your skills are awesome, like getting a cold/fire fusion bomb on dodge. Controller support is excellent. Boss battles are pretty good, and enemy density increases as you progress.  The mediocre: there are only two weapons from which to choose, and it takes a few runs to unlock the spear, which functions similarly to the starting sword. More weapons would be good. Enemy models and level layouts are okay. Upgrades that affect your survivability, crit, statuses, etc. are so conditional to activate that they're basically worthless and make no difference in your run.  The bad: English translations of the dialogue are very poor to the point of being occasionally hilarious. I don't know if there is a story as I skipped the unreadably bad dialogue. I recommend doing the same. Some explanations of game mechanics are also poorly translated, so you have to intuit what they do. After one or two runs, it's a bit too easy to finish. It only took me three runs, which is bad for longevity. There doesn't seem to be an endgame system in place that makes you want to continue your metaprogression to continue unlocking things and taking on harder challenges. I suppose there's a way to increase the difficulty but no real reason to chase them. I haven't tried.  The awful: co-op mode doesn't apply to the normal game. There's some separate 'shelter' mode where your character's upgrades carry over IF and ONLY IF you haven't finished a run. So, you need to do 3/4ths of a run to get upgrades, stop the run and move to 'shelter' mode with a friend? Makes no sense, and it's some kind of unexplained side-objective + tower defense mode? I don't get it, and it's very poorly implemented. Don't buy this for co-op.  The fifth stage sets up an epic boss battle, and then the credits just roll with no big ultimate boss battle. Why?   To the developer: implement co-op on the main game - highest priority. This would likely change my opinion to a 'recommend'.",0
137915488,1824960,"I can recommend this and I can't, it's short as in chew through in an hour short. The visuals and atmosphere are premium tier I'm usually a bit of a rock when it comes to horror but this certainly got the blood flowing without cheesy jumpscares.   The good things; -The atmosphere really gives you a sense of isolation, giving every corner and doorway a tense feeling. -Audio is excellent, the sound design grips your throat with tension never knowing what groans, creaks and steps are coming from the next room. -Game play is pretty standard survival horror, manage your ammo, healing items and batteries. -The scares aren't typical jump in your face type things they've really mixed the audio, atmosphere and gameplay to put you in the right position for these encounters.  The issues;  -Player position is not tied to HMD position, it is wherever the headset was before you started the game.(Physically moving around the room has gotten me stuck on a wall more often than not.) -Enemy clipping into objects/walls once ragdolled.(not often, but enough to be an issue for such a short experience) -Ammo, Health and Batteries feel too plentiful; finished Nightmare with plenty to spare. -Inventory is a bit clunky and can clip into the world.(A radial wheel for key items at the least would be a more comfortable option)",1

Highly discourage purchasing, especially for the price, at this time.

I usually don't review my games until I have at least a good 5 hours especially the EA games but this game does so much wrong that I felt like I must warn people. 1. The tutorial is nonexistent  2. You have to maneuver the character in a particular way to turn whatever you are trying to pick up (not a big deal) But instead of telling me that I can pick it up why not tell me what it is? Certain things you might already have enough of and don't want to waste space on say acorns. 3. The controller support in this game is terrible sometimes to open doors you have to press the A button 2 times, whenever I try to talk to anyone they just keep on walking and I have to try 3-4 times (most likely due to the A button not working correctly)    Personally I don't like games in this genre that have little to no controller support, I have hand problems so keyboard playing games are not really my thing.

Checking also feels difficult sometimes idk how i fully feel about this but having your player kinda ""gravitate"" to the person you wanna check would be nice but it might make it op. Just some things in general feel like they need target aiming just to make it a little easier to hit things but I feel at the same time its part of learning the game and it feels good to finally hit that stupid prince as hes charging his slap shot.

137918013,1824960,"I am on the Oculus Quest 2 pcvr using AirLink. I’ve been playing two years, played dozens of games, and I have all of the AAA games on pc.  This game is awful and I requested a return. Basically, the zombies you kill reanimate which means that while you are trying to solve the puzzles by examining clues you’re also burning through all your bullets killing the reanimated. Which means you can’t continue. It seemed like I could kite some of the dead into rooms and shut them in but that doesn’t always work.  For the first boss fight you have to run in a circle and shoot him until he dies. But trying to run is nearly impossible as it barely moves faster than the boss and one mistake and you’re screwed.  Propagation Paradise Hotel isn’t a great zombie game or a great puzzler. It’s a static environment game where you do a lot of back and forth between floors as you ascend to the roof to be recused.  I hate static environment VR games. Why go through all the trouble of creating an environment if the player cannot interact with anything except what is necessary for the immediate progress of the game? I opened and closed about 100 doors and drawers. And picked up the bullets, batteries, and health necessary. That’s pretty much it. Same as any old console game. You can’t even interact with the dead zombies and move their heads.   There was such a great opportunity to create boundaries and kill zones for zombies. Moving coat racks, stacking suitcases, doors opened to herd zombies like cattle, etc. Instead we got what is essentially a flat interactive adventure.  It’s not a shooter. It’s not like you have to strategize or mow down more than two at a time between long breaks. It’s just blast away while trying not to get caught up. The zombies are really not even essential. It could have been anything. Using zombies almost seems like an easy out.   And the zombies themselves are really implemented awfully. It takes multiple head shots to down one simple zombie and then…somehow…it’s just back? A lot of people mentioned the atmosphere and how scary it was. That wore off after the first five minutes when tedium began to take over. When the zombies reanimate in the exact same place you realize you’re going to have to kill that same dead guy again and again as you go back and forth trying to move the game forward.  And it’s not a puzzle game either. The whole game is walking back and forth through the same type of environment and taking item one from place a to place b. Oh, now you need item 2, rinse and repeat. A cheap gimmick.  I did really like the menu system. It was easy to use and tabbed really well. And it was impossible to lose anything, which is absolutely necessary since the whole game is essentially dark.  I played on normal level and that was fine in difficulty. The difficulty isn’t really in the gameplay itself, it’s the simple stuff like moving and kiting.  I’m still waiting for a really great zombie game. This wasn’t it.",0

This game has pretty much all you need if you have a spare hour or so to throw sheep at enemies and miss every shot. This game looks and sounds great, but I only have a couple of complaints.   First of all, the mouse sensitivity was something to get used to, even when turned all the way down. But I guess that's what I get for playing a Unity game. Not a huge complaint, nor is anything else I mention.  The lack of a general cross-hair is something that made my high-enemy fights just a bit more stressful. It's difficult to move and shoot when there's no indication of where the sheep go until after you start shooting. This forces you to slow down and look directly at an enemy before you can shoot. And if you have 20 things chasing you down and you don't have some sort of defense, it's gonna leave you being launched by an orc.   This game is an overall treat to play and I would recommend pretty much anyone to at least try it out. Happy gaming!  -CharredSoup <3",1

The second game really didn't give you much for the 5 bucks you had to pay for it, but I think this game does. Although the third game can be beaten in the same or even less time than the second, I think it makes up for that with way more content. Unlike the second one, this game has cutscenes, humor, a story thats a bit more cohesive, a boss fight, puzzles, etc. Certain things haven't been fixed from the previous games, like unoptimized models and okay-ish voice acting, and there are a few moments that are boring and take away from the game a little. Overall though, it's pretty worth the $5 price tag. And there is one pretty important thing I would like to mention, this game runs noticeably better than the second. In the second game, you had to crank down your settings to get any good fps, and the game would end up looking horrible.

In a horror game? what about a couple dark rooms and some really, really underwhelming jumpscares. you can also FEEL the incessant malice the devs felt toward people refunding their previously horrendous game through this one's design. There are so many sections that are there solely to waste time. So much exposition that didn't need to be given to you via unskippable cutscene, over other more interesting means. Minigames that are obnoxiously tight and difficult solely so you have to retry them over... and over... i could go on. The big """"chase sequence?"""" [spoiler]the only control you have is speeding up or slowing down your bird while you're railroaded toward a repetitive puzzle. Using Exclusively Two Buttons On Your Keyboard. so, so, so very clear the entire scene exists solely to be put in the trailer. [/spoiler]    the god awful fetch quest """"puzzles"""" are back, obviously. the one slightly cool thing they tried to do immediately became repetitive and boring when I realised they put maybe half an hour into creating the entire sequence start to finish. Finally, the models are still obnoxiously high poly, why wouldn't they be. Every piece of music, while being an original composition, is short enough to where it noticeably loops during gameplay, becoming grating to listen to.   please for the love of god do not support this. the euphoric brothers have been given PILES upon PILES of cash and genuine criticism, only to continually churn out games consistent in quality with banban 1. They've clearly demonstrated that they could not give a rat's ass about actually improving their product and just want to lure in a younger audience for that sweet sweet mascot horror revenue. I've seen people say this is a good pick if you want fun on a budget, but there are so many amazing indie horrors out right now, you do NOT have to give your money to the cashgrab one.

It has some bugs, but those are going to eventually be fixed. Dev Team are paying attention to any infinites possible and are patching them as soon as possible. I really recommend for players who never played a fighting game before and doesn't want to buy a full price game. It's easy to pick up but it looks like it might have a nice ceiling of difficulty. Time will tell if I'm right or not. Also, single player is really fun to play.   As someone who loves Blazblue CF and Melty Blood, this game is awesome even though it doesn't nearly feel like that (it feels like a Granblue Fantasy Versus with more complex combos).  The training mode could be better though. It's quite difficult to lab new stuff in it's current state. I trust they'll improve it once the polish the online.  Also, they plan to add four new characters for FREE.   On a side note, I would love to play Korone, but she's a Shoto and it's too honest (like real Korone) so I'm maining Suisei.",1

Extremely high replay value with many different maps, and a progression between maps. Overall, I enjoy playing AoW in this fantasy realm with dragons and magic. Strategically, the game plays very much like Planetfall, but there are a number of new features. I suppose if I were being extremely critical, I'd point out that magic is simply a reskinning of previous mechanics: you spend resources to buff your units.

For those familiar with AoW3 it's that with improvements in just about all ways posible.. For those not familiar with the AoW games think Civ5 in a fantasy setting with better tactical combat, better world map, more customizable units and to top it up heroes and gear..

I see no logical progression steps, no apparent reason or result to any event... just walk around a wait for something to happen, maybe? I dunno, got annoyed and turned it off. I've gotten stuck in games before; I ain't no genius or master detective, but in this game, there's literally NOTHING that leads to any logical progression so far..  Oh and the random teleporting in the hallway... that's like copying PT but without any effort to even match the original, let alone improve on it.

Being an incredibly small incredibly stupid child the only real ""strategy"" I could formulate was to turn off all the penalties and then only ever score by slamming my players directly into the goalie at full speed.  This game fully captures the spirit of those days for me. The overt cheating (I like throwing my stick directly at the person who tries to magically encase my players in ice), the lack of penalties, and the entire hockey spirit are on full display here.   The game is hard, but the developers are very quick to receive feedback and adjust accordingly. In the few days since it has been live they have given it a big patch with several quality of life overhauls based directly on player feedback. Is it perfect? No, not yet, but it is extremely FUN, and I have no doubt with developers this active in the community it will grow into something remarkable.",1

The pace of this game is extremely rewarding and when you get beat on a higher tier the dopamine release of coming back with new strategies and getting a win is unrivaled.

While I understand that the commander has the roll of resource management and deciding on what to create, I feel like if an infantry player could spend personal points to build a vehicle it could make things flow a little better early on.  Also being able to spawn in said vehicle would be nice, provided you have the extra points and are happy to wait for it to be built (the build time an queue could be used to manage people spamming vehicles).  Choosing which building to spawn at instead of having to run to the barracks to get the rocket to help kill the op attacking your other building, the maps are huge, understandably for the RTS aspect, so a quicker way to move around would be nice, maybe teleporters at every building?",1
137922957,1494420,I bought this because I like bugs and have played pretty exclusively as bugs. Things it needs. (1) Better way to group and ungroup units for control Including an escort type function in FPS so you aren't lone wolfing all the time while the parking lot is full back at base. (2) Turn friendly fire off. Team killers are a scourge. Also being able to switch teams mid game is odd and incentives this behaviour. (3) give friendlies and identifying dorito in the HUD (4) Let players choose units to respawn into. Marching back up to the front line sucks and so does chasing around searching for a tank or favourite bug. (5) I couldn't work out how to use the teleport function_ needs more intuitive UI. (6) Some bugs need more speed to chase down those buggies before dying to range fire on these really open terrain maps. I'm looking at you hunter.. (7) A better indication of when you are damaging stuff. I think there are flashes wen you hit but I see the same effect when i shoot rocks so I don't know.  (8) Flying bugs and flying units. Probably a load of work and might break the game.  I love how bugs can climb and use terrain. I love the FPS mode but man the AI commander is a bit sucky.  Group play is a lot of fun but its odd that you can switch teams mid game and go on a team killing spree.,1

137923849,2337630,"This is an embarrassment , how can you say that this is a finished product. The game is so clunky nothing works, the mechanics are so broken. I don't understand how anyone has given this a positive review, it literally requires an overhaul on everything. AFL evolution plays 1000 times better than this, handballs are going 50 metres takes a year to kick the ball in general play. The fact that Big Ant has the audacity to charge $99 for this utter garbage, I would of been better off putting $99 on North Melbourne winning the flag. I would recommend waiting to purchase until they fix, its pathetic. Any positive review is a fake post.",0
137924807,2211730,I played for about 2.5 hours straight and I think I blinked like twice. The movement and control in KILLBUG is addictive and smooth as butter.

The music is pretty dope too and gets increasing intense as you get further. I highly recommend!!!,1
137924649,1366850,"What an awful game, so far. Stick to the arcade racing aspect.   The jet flying is not nearly as fleshed out as the racing. One track has a particularly long section of flying where you can literally run out of jet fuel and become stranded, and being forced to respawn only gives little fuel.   The sky dive challenges are just not fun at all.",0
137924261,1824960,"This is a solid horror title for VR.  As other's have mentioned, it has a similar style and feel to the original Resident Evil game from back in the day.

I hope the devs will continue to work on this and other titles as they make solid experiences.",1
137924715,1649130,Knight Crawlers is a wonderful game which involves you going through multiple different levels (rooms) where you and the enemies are going to progressively become stronger. You are not intended to make it far your first few delves as once you inevitably die (or choose to go back to the sanctuary) you can upgrade your stats or at a later point choose dominations to have. As you continue to play the game starting a delve for the first time and for the 20th will show you on a completely different power level.  I would love to comment on the good and the bad but this game is very much still in development and what was a bug yesterday is fixed the next. So I have no clue what issues I can comment on that will stay,1

I've tried using DS4Windows to have it read keyboard inputs, but since there's no way to disable the controller readings in the game, the game wasn't able to take my controller's inputs as just keyboard.

137927089,2086140,I'm not a huge fan. The upgrades aren't very interesting. Meta progression isn't very interesting and slow. The game encourages you to repeat the same level a lot of times since you lose all your meta currency if you go to the next level. In combat I take damage without really knowing why. I'm not even 100% sure what's dangerous on the screen and what isn't. After a point all level ups feel useless. This +1 damage or +5% attack speed but -10% crit doesn't seem to do a lot. There aren't a lot of upgrades and they're all very similar. +X damage where X can be something from 1 to 8. It's the same with all the level up upgrades. One of the few interesting ones is the +1 weapon slots that is vital. You see it you take it. With full weapon slots even weapon drops aren't interesting.,0

137927851,1494420,"I agree with everyone else here about the issues with the game. The one that irks me the most is the alien faction is OP. Like ridiculously OP. An alien scorpion single handedly took out 4 light vehicles and 8 rifleman, and my humans had a solid 30 second free for all of just unloading full auton on this scorpion as it moseyed up the hill and it didn't even lose half its health before I quit the game because of this ridiculous onslaught from one single average alien unit.   Beyond this, the FPS mode is just unenjoyable due to a multitude of reasons: map size being too big for the scale of combat being carried out, enemies are insane bullet sponges, it takes too long for unit qty and quality to build up for an actual fun combat exchange, the insane lack of balance between aliens and humans.  This game needs to cook for awhile. Maybe buy it down the line, but it needs some real work, a lot of tweaks and balances, and they need to fix the massive map; either make there be way more units, or make the map way smaller.",0
137927035,1494420,good,1
137926999,1494420,"As good looking and great this game is... it is held back by the poor server browser and lack of steam invite integration. Game-play is great and plays very well. The humans can be completely broken when fighting against the aliens. It is some what balanced if either the Aliens have a competent player AND commander, not one or the other. If either team has humans behind them, they will outshine the A.I. by a large margin. This is not to include that the A.I. is dumb as bricks in base building nor auto attack a target within range at times. The routing for units in game (This includes the Harvesters, good lord they are bad.) needs work for various reasons. (won't climb, can't back up, terrible and long routing to target.) A player can't enjoy the FPS game-play when the AI commander is giving them a dog water hand in units. Visually this game looks great and my friends and I enjoy it... to a degree. The biggest issues are multiplayer and the net-code. I will not recommend the game in current early access until both single player has decent A.I. and there is functional online play that doesn't require a work around. Great game overall the issues and I hope it succeeds in the future.  Will change review after most problems are address.",0

137928354,1366850,This is a lot of stupid fun.  Give yourself a couple hours or so to get the hang of and a feel of the game's controls.  I eventually got to a point where I was using my car midair to give myself tighter turns for my jet pack to pull off 90 degree and 180 degree turns.    The game feels like a combination of arcade driving and momentum controlling.    I would recommend giving the game a shot.  MAYBE hold off on buying anything just yet as I frankly havent noticed a difference between cars and characters just yet myself and I suspect that these other packs are just cosmetic purchases for now.  I could be wrong.    Hopefully they avoid pay to win or deliberate purchases of power antics.  I would pay money for cosmetics and maybe customization stuff for visuals.  I'm not sure how I would feel buying characters and cars that have fundamentally different effects on the gameplay.  Unless they take the Valorant route?  I dunno.  I'm very new to F2P games.    But there is something satisfying here when you get into the groove of the game and I think it's worth keeping an eye on and giving it a try.,1

137926924,2311190,"I sincerely found this game enjoyable. I played the first two games with some pals and found them quite silly, scary at times, and a good time to be had with friends. However, this game was different, you're in for a bit more of a ride in more ways than one. You don't exactly know what's going on, you feel lost and, at many times, you actually do get lost, but there's always something going on, making it feel like more of a game. I found myself saying ""woah! that's actually a cool idea!"" more than once, the puzzles were pretty neat and I still mean it when I said I enjoyed the game. When I was getting far in and realized I had done a lot, I didn't want it to end. The story is a bit hard to follow, but that kind of adds to the strangeness of it all; you have no real clue what the heck is happening, but you're just here to go through it, and you don't really have a choice. You meet new monsters, old monsters, you make friends, you make enemies, and you laugh. This one's a bit less scary, a bit more puzzley, and a lot more funny, its clear the author's are paying attention to the community and making jokes that you would never expect, which makes it simply absurd, and a very enjoyable fever dream.

I've managed to finish medium difficulty at the point of writing and it provided me with a slightly decent challenge. There won't be much replayability to expect since the storyline is pretty much linear and only offers the same ending - only reason to replay is to give yourself a challenge by ramping up the difficulty curve.  That being said, the developers did a good job with this concept of a XCOM x Reality Deathmatch themed gameshow. The storyline also managed to capture my attention, which is a huge bonus because quite frankly most of us won't care about the plot unless it is really interesting.  TL;DR - You like XCOM styled, squad turn-based tactical games? This is definitely worth the buy :)",1
137929140,1155330,"Having only played fantasy turn based games like divinity (in which i got 160hrs+) i wasn't expecting much from a shooter. But I loved the unique TV-show theme so I decided to finally give one go - oh boy what a gem it is!  Story while may seem like a simple revenge is actually interestingly executed. Everyone have their backstories, a lot of stuff to click on for some lore and fluff. And if someone is not fan of it, most of it is optional or skippable so we can just progress to the most fun part of the game!  The gameplay - Characters have fun abilities and actually many of them! Lack of abilities and mostly just shooting was my biggest worry going in to a tactical shooter, but i was worried for nothing. There are a lot of abilities! Melee kill chain setups with Scarlett once you unlock enough perks are so satisfying! There is itemization, character progression, sponsorship bonuses, new characters, theres always something new as I progress. It never got stale or boring.

137928960,1566200,"Very great concept, has all the potential to be a great game and will likely be there once fully released. I really like it right now and will definitely be playing it a lot more. I’ve been playing on expert and here’s a few of my gripes with the gameplay although it’s mostly good:  1. Not being able to intercept the puck when the opposing goalie passes it feels really bad, especially when it goes straight through my player standing in front of an empty net.  2. Not being able to deck the goalie standing still looking for a pass seems out of place in the chaotic world of tape to tape. I think making the AI goalie distribute more quickly and more accurately could make it fair for the player to intercept the goalies passes because they wouldn’t be going straight to the player, they would be better passes and the goalie would pass quick enough to not get decked. 3. The meatball team sometimes scores goals that are absolutely unstoppable. Sometimes the goalie will shoot it down the ice to a player I cannot physically guard who will rip it and score. 4. Shooting seems impossible for benchwarmers and low level heroes or whatever they’re called. I feel like I cannot score off of a shot ever, even if it is a breakaway. For someone with ~30/30 shooting stats, I feel like at least one of five breakaway shots should go in instead of what it has actually been for me, like one in fifty. Maybe nerfing the goalies on both sides would feel more rewarding for the player and allow for more action packed higher scoring games.  All this being said, I am a noob playing on expert who only just beat the officials after a few hours of playing. All in all, very good game!",1

But god damn when ur playing a game, like a long game and u finally get the upper hand and the host rage quits and the whole game loses connection. 5th game in a row and every one of them with a deciding factor of a outcome of very little chance of winning. if the host is on the losing side they rage quit causeing the game to just be a wash. last game was an 1h and 30 mins i send a pack of those fast bugs with the 2 tenticals on top and killed 6 harvesters with them which of been a massive income diffrence for us but noooooo host had to rage quit right after",1

137930312,2337630,Wasn't going to leave a review as I could kind of put up with the many little flaws this game has until I played an online match where neither player could pick up the ball at all and all we could do was soccer kick or tap the ball along the ground... if I wanted to play soccer I would've bought FIFA.

137931726,1375900,"I like the concept a lot, and the game plays well... but at this point it's not fun IMO. A couple reasons: 1. There's no way to get out of a swarm. Yes, I know it's in the title, but really, once you got surrounded, it's GG. There's no way to get out of that situation whatsoever. May give us a dash or a bomb or something? 2. Every run is similar. The weapon/build variation just isn't there. It's boring. 3. The first boss is a surprise speed check. Think you don't need movement speed? Well think again - because the first boss tracks you faster than you can move out of the range, and that's even with 3 upgrades in speed ,5% + 2*3% = 11% total speed increase and still can't move away. I guess one way is to sacrifice an upgrade to get more movement, or trigger enough mobs to hope to get rapid healing. But this is silly, because drop rate is not a guarantee.  4. The mobs in general scales faster than we can level up. 5. Some weapons are just better. If the game has a DPS chart, we'd be able to see which weapon did what. 6. Some upgrades make no sense at lower level. Burn upgrade? Are you serious?! We don't get benefit unless we invest heavily in passives like torch, or until we got more perma upgrades that gives us burn chance. Either way it's more awkward than useful.",0
137931557,1375900,"Overall good, not that hard though and with only two ""classes"" to pick between there doesnt really feel like much content here yet, I was hoping for more weapons besides 2 of each type of which there is 3, Rapid, Blade, launcher.

Its nice to want to have the game played for so many hours but 30 minutes for the starting crop seems extravagant. End game crops/animals shouldn't even be over 2-3 hours honestly.

Maybe 1 minute for wheat then double the time increment for each additional or something.,1

Even in its buggy early-access form, it offers endless amounts of entertainment both as a commander and an infantry unit. Continual bug reports from players and bug fixes by the dev will only turn an already great framework of a game into an absolute masterpiece fusion of two genres in due time. Just remember, if you're playing it during Early-Access, to look past the buggy NPC actions and semi-frequent UI and mechanical bugs and notice the incredible new dimensions of strategy being added by the terrain of the maps, the unique fog-of-war mechanics, the resource economy balance between humans and aliens, and the balance and breadth of unit types and their strengths and weaknesses when being controlled by NPCs versus actual players. I genuinely look forward to watching this game grow.",1

I am surprised that this company released a game in this state.  Don't get me wrong, this game CAN be fun, but devs need to do some serious changes and updates in order to be fun to play.

I just had to keep expanding to new islands which gave me iron and a lot of very needed followers.   Other feedback: During the tutorial I really hated that it moved my cursor around to highlight things. It's not by any means game ruining, but I just really didn't like it.   When trying to click on the button to get new cards, it didn't work if It was over a building. I had to move my camera to an open area to click the button.

137939398,1669000,"Triumph Studios does only one thing and they do it well since the late 90s. This game is another masterpiece in the fantasy 4X genre. Perfection doesn't exist, but we're getting pretty damn close :  Bad   - Mediocre combat UI. As much as the campaign UI is great the combat one is a mess. You get used to it after a while but there's no reason why buffs and debuffs aren't clearly displayed with mouseover infos above the unit's stats at the bottom. Will be fixed eventually, either by the devs or by mods, but still.  - Combat performance is ""bad"". I know it's bad bad for some people, I personally have good FPS but I do hear my beefy PC breathe heavily during combat. And while the game looks great it doesn't look 3080ti-and-12900k-sweating-buckets great, so some optimization may be required.  Neutral   - It's a game where players have a lot of ""creative freedom"" when customizing their factions. Which means that stuff will be unbalanced as hell : enchantment-stacked fortune-fed tome of the Horde tier 1 archers with 100+ damage volleys, hero support skills being vastly better than battle or magic skills, wizard king origin that can win battles turn 1 or 2 by double casting OP spells while the ascended champion twiddle their thumbs. And that's just after 35h of gameplay. While I don't mind it one bit because I only play solo or coop vs AI I don't know how PvP will play out...  - The soundtrack is good as always, but nothing really sticks out for me. It's a nice ambient jam but lacks the bangers of the first couple of Age of Wonders games. That's just my personnal taste though.  Good   Everything else. If I had to single out a couple of improvements over previous games :  - The tome system is fantastic, so much freedom. While as I said before this might create balance issues in PvP it is an absolute treat in PvE. A beginner can focus on one theme and do just fine while a veteran can start experimenting with culture and tome combinations for some truly strong custom builds. *Chef's kiss*  - Unit enhancements/transformations are so nice to use compared to Planetfall's unit mods. Pretty much the same depth without any of the hassle.   - I really like the way they've made your average custom game be a part of the overall ""meta"" game progression with the Pantheon system. I know a lot of people might be bummed by the lack of a full narrative campaign but I'm not a fan of those campaigns where you play a bunch of different premade characters and factions. I pretty much only ever played custom games anyway.  - The new siege system is good. Adds a new layer of possibilities and in the end plays better than Planetfall garrisons and obviously better than having to leave armies in your cities at all times to avoid some random enemy flying scout razing your whole metropolis ._.  So yeah, the game looks great, plays great, has awesome replayability and a wealth of content and possibilites. If you're not the biggest fan of how messy and janky Total War's real time battles can get then Age of Wonders 4 offers the cleanest turn-based strategy combat on the market. While it is hard to compete right off the bat with the sheer amount of content and IP of the Total War Warhammer games and DLCs, this game comes pretty damn close, for a fraction of the price and with a better polish.  Age of Wonders games are 5 out of 5 for me, keep 'em coming Triumph.",1

Annoying! - Multiplayer: Feels bugged, desyncs happen regulary. (However fixes with a Reload button) - Multiplayer: You need to wait for someone to finish their battles before doing anything, some battles can take 20-25 minutes.

Inspired by the S.T.A.L.K.E.R-series you explore [i]the zone[/i] around the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant after the devastating man-made nuclear disaster. You encouter anomalies, mutants and bandits. Everything can kill you. Your gun is your only friend. The story is told in the form of cutscenes, ingame events, text and audio. You will read a lot and better read carefully because the game won't hold you by the hand and give you shiny lines to follow to the objective. You have a PDA with basic info about the mission but you'll have to remember what's being reported by the NPCs. The gameplay is tactical exploration + shooter with enemy and ammo management. Keep your eyes and ears open and don't rush. Check for anomalies and watch your environment.  Technical the game is very good, it has VR-support (obviously), 3D-audio, basic graphics configuration and a lightweight client (~4GB). Z.O.N.A comes with Ukrainian, English, Simplified Chinese & a new German Localization. Before the release there was a Demo where you could try the game. This could be seen as a Beta-Test, too. Therefore you can say the game has been tested by manys before its release. Between the release on May the 2nd '23 and today, May the 7th '23, Z.O.N.A already received two updates and one even included a new localization! Like the new S.T.A.L.K.E.R-game, geographical names are transcribed on the basis of Ukrainian language. Therefore you will visit [i]Chornobyl [/i]when playing in English and [i]Tschornobyl [/i]when playing in German. The developer [i]AGaming+[/i] reported about his personal experiences as a child in Prypiat. You can read it in the discussions. I dare to say that Z.O.N.A is not just a game but a processing of family history.

I do understand this game is early access, but I am not a fan of games being released without being thoroughly tested. I am going back to gamecube with NHL Hitz 2003. One of the best hockey games ever made in my opinion.",0
137938930,1566200,One of the earliest early access games i have ever played. Extremely buggy and unpolished. I see the idea of the game but there are just way too many issues to be able to recommend it.,0
137938591,1566200,"Definitely rough around the edges, body checking collision needs a bit of work and puck collision seems to favor ai by quite a huge amount(they almost always get the puck when you are both on it).  Scoring also feels a bit inconsistent.  But the game is super fun and has lots of potential, although the above problems make it a bit frustrating at times. Gives me a strong blades of steel vibe and if above problems get tuned/polished i would whole heartedly recommend this game.   Since this game just hit early access i'll give it a positive review since the base for an amazing game is there it just needs some refinement.",1
137939297,1494420,"A genre transcending SciFi All Aspect Warfare Sandbox -----------------------------------------------------------  In the last couple of days of playtesting/analysing Silica, I was amazed by the scope and level of detail of this game project.  What Martin ""Dram"" Melichárek (the developer) has achieved here is nothing short of SuperHuman...  ...from the scope in scale and hybrid genre mixing down to low level details such as the way ground surfaces are rendered with tessellation details. All the incredible detailed game systems (such as realistic physics and ballistics behavior) are properly synchronized across the network/internet in a butter smooth and performant way.  Having had a brother at the other side of planet playtesting this project at tough high latency network conditions while giving crucial network gameplay related feedback, seemed to really have paid out massively to the benefit of this game.  The netcode programming aspect of games that feature multiplayer usually is a way too often neglected aspect of programming in today's developed games, resulting in sub-optimal online experiences for a majority of multiplayer titles.  So I am particularly pleased/delighted with the level of work and thought that went into that aspect for this game project.  And while this game is still early in development and in Early Access there are glimpses of what amazing elements the future may bring (i.e. the introduction of Aerial Units and Dedicated Servers) which will only further broaden the scope of this game as an All Aspect Warfare Sandbox that crosses different popular game genres.  Please keep up this amazing work.",1
137939140,1494420,"I normally do not write reviews but I find this game really cool and I think it has a lot of potential. The Harvester breaks the game as of now, so please make sure to fix it as soon as possible!",1
137938268,1494420,"so thoughts ...  For an Alpha I'm surprised it has a good amount of play time to offer and lets you play around with ease. for the moment there are three playable factions however two are the same at the  moment. The aliens are different for sure not what I would normally play but worth trying that being said the balance is good for the most part between them all just wish the human factions had at least two types of units to use/ build for the different factions instead of one.  like the old style NOD and GDI style two human factions with different units.  So the overall looks of the game are brilliant for the stage its in.  Time has been taken to make sure units scale is as close to what you would call ""realistic"" as possible and the scale is no joke the crystal harvesters are massive in comparison to other units or buildings in all great work on the units and base buildings they all look great. Environment is alright bland due to the desert vibe of the game but still looks impressive. some features could use some work like the bunkers in the world they seem a little off and placed strange.  As far as playing with friends its pretty simple either private  or public finding games is simple enough. no in game quick join or add as of yet but I'm sure in time there will be.  some controls feel a little meh with the alien side however i feel that may be player side more than game just not using then enough for example.  the three game modes at the moment are a great way to test and mess around with the game lets you get a vibe of it and whats good whats not really like that.  Overall i would say its worth the buy in the stage its in if you miss the old RTS vibe and what to try something new with the commander/ infantry twist and without the crap cartoony looks like COH3.  thanks for reading and taking my thoughts onboard i hope you try it too and give a constructive feedback on it aswell  at the moment the games a very solid 7.5/10 :)",1
137938098,1494420,This game is awesome. The graphics & animations look really cool. Its very fun to play with your friends. This game also gives me a bit of DUNE & Star Wars jabba the hutt vibes. The game is very beautifully made and much respect to this one man developer. My money goas to you sire 100% worth it.  Only one big problem at the moment. When playing as humans the harvesters are too slow with collecting resources. They tend to get stuck between buildings. In my opinion i think they are just too large it would be better if there were smaller units for collecting resources. Altough they look very cool but its just not practical. The Aliens have smaller units for collecting resources and they just destroy you after a while because your resource collectors cant keep up.  Also hellicopters would help allot with the alien players secretly destroying my ULTRA HEAVY Factory frome the top of the building. But i believe you are already working on that.  Also the game stutters after a while in commander mode but i gues thats because of the 400 units in play at that moment. Or my pc just sucks.  Anyway love it thanks for making such a great game.,1
137937651,1494420,"Very fun game! Has a little lag in some areas of the maps with a little graphic issue with certain areas not rendering in properly (a game restart fixed this bug perfectly). Everything that is playable character or creature is buggy in its own way, so is every mode and map. Changing from 1st to 3rd person (or vice versa) is also quite buggy. The variety of what can be played is good (in arena mode this is), however in other modes, its quite disappointing with how little can be played as of now. However, definitely worth investing time into establishing whether or not this is a game for you, before the full game gets released!

The mechanics make little sense, zombies do not stay dead unless their heads are completely destroyed, which can't happen with the pistol, the first of two guns you get in the entire game, which means that in the majority bulk of the game, you wont be able to truly ""kill"" and zombies, but merely incapacitate them and they'll get up a couple minutes later. The shotgun, which the second and final gun you get in the game, is introduced too late into the game for have any real fun with it. It is really alarming to know that the game has an achievement that requires you to complete the game in under an hour.

For the price, it's a really really great thing to experience, and a great example of what you can do with Ren.Py and lots of imagination.  The hand-drawn art is lovely to look at and brings the world to life surprisingly easily, and the music is delightfully atmospheric.

137940564,1673090,"This game is delightful, with cativating quests, pretty graphics, funny adventures and just the right amount of complexity. You can craft items, buy a house, grow your farm and build your reputation! How fun is that in a 2D game that we can play with friends?  Very happy with the game. I do get a little upset sometimes about small things, but that is my competitive behaviour. The soundtrack is fun, but gets repetitive after a while in the same area. I would love to have a little bit more diversity on that.  Also, the regeneration of hp is confusing among other details regarding game mechanics. Maybe make it a little more clear, tutorial or instructions maybe?  Something I didn't enjoy and I think it's important to me, is when finishing a quest, if, by mistake, we want to go to the inventory and come back to chat with a certain character, you lose the ability to re-read what the response was. There is no log or ability to review what has been done. I think that could be a huge improvement and doesn't seem too hard to apply.  Other than that, I loved the game! Please, don't stop here.

Not perfect, but very strong and has a lot of potential for the dev team to sharpen it up and expand it. Definitely recommend.",1
137941339,1669000,"A longtime fan of the series here. This is easily my favourite installment by far.   Love the amount of customization and stories that emerge while playing the game and leading your chosen faction, coupled with excellent 4X gameplay. BUT the biggest leap in comparison with AOW 1-3 is the presentation - the game looks beautiful, the art style is top-notch, hero models and units are detailed and a joy to look at, something that was severely lacking in previous games. Easily the best looking fantasy strategy ever made, they finally nailed it!  Pros: - Excellent mix of 4X and HoM&M style games. - Beautiful art style. Seriously, no amount of praise is enough. Every single unit is beautifully designed and modelled. Living Fog from the Shadow Tome is *chef's kiss*. - The amount of customization when it comes to creating your faction is astounding. Various traits, enchantments, summons, transformations... just wow! Same goes for generating a Realm. - Interesting exploration via side-quests and empire events. - Engaging gameplay loop. - Awesome soundtrack. - Tactical battles are better than ever, striking the perfect balance between streamlining and complexity. - A truckload of new features and improvements. - Attention to detail, such as your actual units & heroes being visible during various events, when entering an Ancient Wonder or approaching the portal etc. Or naming convention for NPC heroes, all seem consistent and interesting. Or the little bits of lore displayed on a parchment paper when entering an Ancient Wonder. Or the fact that Wizard Kings can opt out of racial transformations while Champions cannot. Or hero mounts being interchangeable.  - Clean UI (with a single caveat, see Cons). - Hot Seat! - It's got DWARVES. - ... and playable Molekin! - Finally no dire penguins everywhere! ^^  Cons: - This is my single biggest gripe. The unit banners during combat are obnoxious, big and ugly. You are given the option to turn them off, but a lot of combat-related information is tied to them and gets hidden when the banners are gone (e.g. the amount of damage dealt and received). An ideal solution would be to either only display banners of your selected unit vs highlighted enemy (it's kind of already there when playing the attack animation) or making the banners MUCH smaller. Or moved to the side of the screen and stacked, Total War style. Currently we've got our custom-made armies and the beautiful environments completely obstructed by the UI.  - An occasional random crash may occur from time to time. Nothing drastic, in my case the game crashed several times over 70 hours I clocked so far, Nothing major but needs to be pointed out. - Physical Form Traits are kind of underwhelming. While Society and Culture provide some game-changing options, Physical Form Traits are just minor stat buffs (+10% damage or +10 HP). Would love to see some more meat here, something more defining.   Side notes: - Some folks complain about the lack of campaign, but personally I don't care, not a fan of campaigns in strategy games anyway. The existing Story Realms do the job just fine.  - Some folks also complain about performance -- can't really tell, the game runs like a charm on a mid gaming spec (RTX 3060 | Ryzen 5600X | 16GB RAM). - Some folks also complain about this not being an Age of Wonders game, because... reasons? I guess some do not like the free-form races or the expanded 4X elements. Dunno, the game has evolved and it's the best iteration yet. Every AOW has been slightly different, bringing in new ideas and dropping some old ones. Direct comparison to AOW1&2/SM would be unfair due to the age gap, but imo AOW4 is miles and leagues ahead of AOW3 & PF.   All in all the game is GOAT. Get it.  9,75/10",1

But at the same time the memory leak at this moment makes it so that in every strategy match, eventually i end up at a steady 5 fps. I start around 100.

Would recommend",1
137940661,1494420,CRAB 10/10,1
137939998,1494420,"Really fun RTS/FPS. It might seem confusing at first, but after you understand the concept of RTS from the POV as an FPS, it will all click in and you will be able to live the chaos of a war through eyes of a soldier (or the crazy commander seeing it happen from above).  I played the StarCraft series, Supreme Commander series + many shooters and I gotta say it's quite fun in its current state with a lot of potential. It is not the best RTS and some FPS aspects could feel less clunky. So yes, there are still bits and pieces where it could be better, but given this is in early access... I can't complain much.  Now if I have to go to details I do have a few bones to pick - Gravity vs. fall damage - you jump like you are on a moon, but get damage as if it was on Earth... weird. - Custom FPS limit - not sure if it is uncapped, but I really would like to limit the FPS (frames per second). - FOV - again, missing settings for that. - Commander AI and its difficulty/capability - I feel like this AI is still not developed enough, because it is not scaling income and not scouting the nearest sources properly. From my experience the game turned into a full blown war when I opened the game as commander, built my way to heavy vehicle factory, then gave the ropes to the AI and enjoyed the chaos as infantry. So I would appreciate if it was either smarter or there were difficulty levels for the commander AI. The problem with this is because it sets the pace of the entire game where it is more or less ok if the AI for tanks or infantry is kinda dumb. - Harvesters are getting stuck on anything - over each other, on crystals, close buildings, over rocks... ugh. - All the rockets in this game are drunk - they take off as if they were fired from FGM-148 Javelin, so you are thinking ""hmm, guided, ok"", after they reach certain height, suddenly they lose all control and somehow just wiggle their way in the general direction where you pointed on the ground or the enemy. I feel like this is because of balancing reasons, but I would rather have longer reload times than just spamming military grade fireworks (not gonna lie, it is fun to watch at least). Now on the other hand, the guided projectiles which aliens shoot? Don't get me wrong, those fly drunk too, but they almost never miss and they don't even explode on impact.  I haven't played as aliens yet, but that will happen once my xeno instincts and human hatred develop enough.  ----------------  Now, if you have made it this far, I will describe my experience what you might encounter too. I hopped into the ""story"" mode, been there for a few minutes, shot a few bugs, but then I decided to try the strategy mode. My first game was as a human infantry. At first I was just randomly wandering about being kind of confused what is happening. Somehow finished the first game, which kinda felt lengthy, but there was a really cool tank which I could drive. In my second game I understood the concept of scouting the environment, so that the commander AI can harvest resources and I was more engaged in the combat. The consecutive games were where the game really picked up the momentum. Suddenly lengthy games turned into resource rushes, picking off enemy scouts, harassing their base as early as possible which later on turned into a strategy as both sides got more advanced units.  Many games later, I'm shooting the xeno scum in my hover tank with my AI squad, while sipping my hot tea. Suddenly, a salvo of several rockets fly over our heads and absolutely obliterate the massive bug in front of us. I look behind myself - ""A f***ing rocket launcher???"". I snitched the thing and it was a blast firing it. This made me think if there is more than just this rocket launcher. So I tried the commander mode and discovered more vehicles which were awesome too (but I will let you discover those yourself).",1
137939635,1494420,"Game is far from ready.  It's a bare-bones early access game, with placeholder UI, barely functional features, no balance, regular recurring frame stutters, and dodgy gameplay. Could barely even be considered a ""proof of concept"". It also has a number of quality issues that you'd expect from early Unreal Engine 4 games. Like they haven't learned from successes and failures from the last decade of games.  As for the concept of the game itself, it tries to follow in the footsteps of games like Natural Selection 2 or C&C Renegade (now RenegadeX), but can't match neither the pace of gameplay, the depths of play / counterplay, nor the playercount for decent games.  I want to enjoy the game because I do enjoy FPS/RTS hybrid games when they're executed well, and I know there is some potential for the developers to turn this into something good, but that might take another 2 years to happen, and better FPS/RTS hybrids will likely release in that time.",0

137942308,1375900,"Mediocre - The game's core gameplay is, unfortunately, entertaining for 1-1,5 hours. Only 2 characters (which to be honest, feel like playing the same character, only different weapons). The game is aspiring very hard to be VS, but It honestly is missing so many things that make its predecessor way better. I was really hyped for epic gameplay that I could delve into and was hoping for a high degree of replayability. The upgrades you pick up, feel impactless. Most of the time you have to stick to the same route, as there are not many choices that would let you survive beyond 5 minutes. Weapons are pretty boring to use and you don't ""feel"" the damage they deal to your enemies. Everything about this game is barren, and it is missing so many things right now that I wouldn't recommend playing it. Big let down for me. I will however, come back to see the progress when creators roll out new updates because as many people mentioned, this game has potential. I will consider changing my review to a positive one then. So to summarise: If u have too much money and are looking for like 2 hours of fun tops - go for it, the game costs more than Vampire Survivors, so if you are looking for a good and satisfying roguelite, then I recommend buying it instead.",0

I wish it had been released as an early-access game while they finished fixing the bugs and AI issues. But I'm playing with my son and we both still like the game, regardless of falling through the floor while running down the street. AI immediately disappears after you shoot them as if they cut and ran for hills or accurate AI shot out where they can see you from a freakin tree and hit you spot on but you can't even see their name tag.  We wish the vampire nests were fully different in each one not the generic first part of the run looking exactly the same while the entrance to the heart is the only part that's different. Makes running back a bit too easy when the first half of the stage is always the same. The Characters are great, regardless of what people are saying, woke this and woke that. I like that you have choices. It's not just picking one. I'm having fun with Layla and my son enjoys Jacob.  This game could be a lot better once it has a really good patch to fix all the glitches with the game. There is still fun to be had here, people. Give it a chance.

Whereas normally the end of other games become snowbally and boring, pushing me to start a new one, the pantheon encourages you to finish the game and progress the pantheon. I really hope it is expanded on in the future and other 4X/strategy games follow suit.  The story realms are a great addition for a focused story driven experience, and I hope more are added in the future.  Race creation has decent depth for a base-game and should only get better as more content is released for it.  Gameplay and graphics are excellent.  Overall balance is good, although some affinities feel significantly stronger than others. Hopefully this can be addressed by bringing some of the lower powered affinities and tomes up to the levels of the stronger ones.",1

137944534,1669000,"As a fan of turn-based strategy games, I was excited to try Age of Wonders 4, and I must say, I was not disappointed. One of the things that stood out to me about the game was its combat system. It was both challenging and fun, and I found myself carefully planning my attacks and turn movements in order to succeed.   Positives: The variety of units available added an extra layer of complexity to battles, which kept things fresh and exciting. I also enjoyed the pace game, which allowed me to forge my own story line and made the game play feel dynamic and engaging. The technology/research, in-game economy, politics, and cultural alignment mechanics added an extra layer of depth to the game and kept me invested all the way through to campaign completion. Speaking of campaign completion, the addition of your character into the halls of your ""pantheon"" is so cool! I put alot of effort into my main character, so it was very rewarding to see him firstly, angelize the entire race of humanity, then become god emperor of mankind, and finally be immortalised forever in my pantheon!  Negatives/wish list: Whilst I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with the game, I did feel like it could have benefited from more core unit variety, especially in the late game. Additionally, I found myself wishing for more customisation options and hero items, as I kept seeing the same high-tier items appear repeatedly. This took away from my immersion a little bit, but I'm not stressed because I know there will be a strong modding community behind this game in the future.  Closing thoughts: Overall, Age of Wonders 4 is an excellent addition to the turn-based strategy genre, and I highly recommend it to all of my friends. While there are some minor areas for improvement, the game is an engaging and I can't wait to start my second campaign to add yet another Godkin to my pantheon.",1
137944511,1669000,A great and solid game straight out of the box.,1
137944430,1669000,"I downloaded a ""demo"" (oh, yes, that kind) of the game, but after a few hours i decided to buy the full game. It's obvious that the devs pored a lot of effort into this game. It was kinda heartwarming to see a (non-indie) game being released without being only half-done or being only barely playable. There are video guides made by the devs, the modding tools and tutorials are readily available.   [u] Didn't regret buying it for a second. [/u]",1

137945106,1566200,"I love hockey. I have played most NHL hockey games and honed my skills.   This game, while similar, is vastly different than a normal NHL game. And it ROCKS. It's super fun, funny, charming, and challenging. It's a rogue-lite, so you will restart a lot and get random artifacts and abilities.   There are not the standard rules of play (off-sides, icing, etc.) and that makes the game fast and furious. That took a little bit of getting used to but once I did I did better.   I haven't used all the abilities, but the one where you throw your stick at whoever has the puck is great.   Pros:  It's hockey you goober Hilarious story/dialogue Fun leveling mechanics Enough of a challenge to keep runs going The women's team is super tough!   Cons: Doesn't follow NHL Rules (but who cares?) Kind of wanky controls  Overall, I would rate this game 8/10 so far in Early Access. I know it wil get better and be closer to 9/10 for me. Looking forward to jumping into this more and more!",1
137944085,1494420,"A gem in need of a lot of polish and love.  Even in early access, this game is really fun to play with some friends. But that's about where the notable positives end. In this EARLY stage, the ui, especially for commander is quite horrid. And for infantry, especially the human side, it's confusing.  Performance running on a ryzen 5600 & RTX 3060ti is most of the time okay. You get performance fitting for the publisher, but also at some points the game was almost unplayable, dipping below 20 fps.  Keeping in mind that this game is marked as early access, and was released less than a week ago from this review, I believe it has a very bright future. [b]Though, I wouldn't encourage you to buy this quite yet, unless you want to support the development process. [/b]",1
137944003,1494420,Awesome,1
137943784,1494420,"[h1] Early Access Review that is subject to change depending on improvement [/h1]  This is undeniably a unique take on the RTS genre, there have been other games which have done something similar but what makes Silica standout is the scale of everything. Unfortunately the game is very much in its infancy, there's a lot missing and leaves much to be desired. Right now I recommend the game on the basis that it has strong foundations but as I said, it lacks content and has many issues.  Given the price of the game and size of the development team however, it makes sense that there's quite a bit missing and how un-optimised everything is. It took Battlefield 2042, a game made by at least 4 different studios half a year to add a scoreboard, Silica has one even if bare-bones at Early Access launch.  What Silica does really well is immersion, the green lightning strikes on one of the maps makes it feel like you're a Zone Trooper in a Tiberium Red Zone from Command & Conquer. The pitch black darkness during the night is great, forcing you to use ""night vision"" making the tracer rounds flying past even brighter. Base structures are clearly a WIP as there's literally not a single flood light anywhere, would be nice if there were lights that aimed at enemies the same way the auto turrets do.  Base building and the RTS part of the game still requires tons of work to bring it on par with the traditional RTS experience, I hope it draws inspiration from Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars in this regard. Oddly enough, performance is better but still inconsistent in the RTS mode and still visually looks great.  The Infantry experience is very 50/50, most of the time it feels like a walking simulator, granted it entirely depends on the commander how they're playing.  It probably won't feel like this as development progresses as stuff such as the teleporter is all very much still a WIP. The MAP and HUD are also clearly a WIP. If soldiers could request deployment of vehicles from terminals within the respective buildings that would also remedy this issue, essentially how it was done in Renegade. Aircraft will massively change this when they're added. Enemies need health displays, particularly the aliens as most of the time it feels like they're bullet sponges.  I'd wager the game is kind of playable, but it is very much an Early Access title that's appropriately priced. There is very poor performance, very buggy movement and still placeholder UI.  I hope that Bohemia Interactive sees the potential behind this game and offers the developer further support, I doubt this game will be ready and meet the level of expectations players have in just ONE year. It needs way more time but if given that time, it could rival so many games including Battlefield.",1

Cultists on the highest available startup difficulty were one-shot, the bigger enemies of vampires were 3-4 shots with the caveat that you have to melee them afterwards.

Finally the tide of war is turning, and Zicka with her invading army fled on the seas tails high. It should not take long for Serah to stand in front of one of Zicka's mighty strongholds. Amids the siege of defenders outnumbering the attackers, Zicka made a preemptive attack with a high chance of winning.  Once more on the defending side, Serah faces Zicka, both leading equally mighty armies in large numbers. Once friends now at war over the mysteries of an Ancient Wonder. Zicka had the advantage with her lucky halflings, seemingly defying fate and physics, and mighty allies in ogres alongside large shrines of smiting - immense mobile combat units which continously bombards the battlefield.  The first to fell victim were the many spider hatchlings in vanguard before bloody battles all over the battlefield broke loose. In their desperation Serah's high noble orcs consumed the corpses of their now dead battle brothers to keep the battle on. The thunderbirds screamed, lightning and thunder flashed all over the battlefield when Zicka's hero stormed on his thunderbird mount through the frontlines, leading skirmishers to break the defenses.  In retaliation fireballs fell upon the halflings before a large portion of Zicka's army felt the wrath of the mighty Stone Spirit teleporting behind their lines to cast earthshattering quakes. ""This realm can only have one ruler!"" Both rallied their troops again and again. The living made way for the raise of undead corpses, overwhelming the attacking bone dragons. The dwarven hero of Serah made way with his greatsword, just to make his last breath at the hands of a common pikeman.  Zicka had Serah outnumbered and outgunned. Yet the valiant orcs will not rest and have their vengeance. Seeing the tide of the battle turning, Zicka's summons see no other way but to buy time for the heroes to flee - by blowing up themselves.

137948666,1622800,"When loading up the game it says:  [b]""ATTENTION. Super Dungeon Maker is still in development. This version is meant to provide a preview of its current state and possibly for you to provide feedback."" - Devs[/b]  Basically its a [b]EARLY ACCESS[/b] game. But its not listed as one on steam which is not fair towards the customers buying something that's listed as a initial release. That obviously doesn't look good since you get this information after you already paid. So if you expected a nice and polished experience form a initial release turn around and come back at a later date.  [b]Feedback:[/b]  The controls also feels a bit clunky and I already ran into a few bugs and frustrating moments. I played through the tutorial for both playing and building. I have a Xbox One Controller and if you play on PC you do expect that to work right. But in the tutorials when the characters tell you what buttons to press it just says ""[none]""... so that's not helpful.  I also played a few online dungeons and I never managed to actually complete any of them cause of the bugs.  Some objects and buttons do not reset when you press the rewind button.  There was some pillars you could push and I accidentally got too close to the water and fell in, this resulted in me continuously respawning next to the pillar and it would push me back into the water again. After hitting rewind the pillars were gone and I couldn't respawn them with the buttons so I just had to start the whole dungeon over again and when this happens and its a big dungeon you basically just give up cause it just wasted 20min of your life.  Sometimes when going through stairs the game just freeze and you have to rewind for the next room to load.  I also don't see why you can only face up, down, left and right. This made it basically a 50/50 that you will get hit when trying to block a attack that's coming at you diagonally.  You also cant break pots with the sword so you have to grab and throw them. That's fine if it didn't feel so slow. This made me wanna avoid interacting with them unless it was necessary.  And there was a lot of other things but I'm not gonna go through it here since it will make this review even longer than it is.  [b]Conclusion:[/b]  This all made it really frustrating to play. I can however see the potential this game has since its a cool idea and the graphics in the dungeons are nice. The village hub however does not match the quality of the dungeons graphics. So over all this game needs to indicate that its actually a [b]EARLY ACCESS[/b] game and its gonna need a lot of quality of life improvements before I'd say its worth buying. I hope this feedback reaches the developers since I don't wanna bother joining their discord and I'll check back in some weeks.",0
137949962,2272420,Realy Good Game. i like how they added ways to fight back against citizens and police. cant wait for the full game,1
137947117,1566200,"This game is going to be my most played indie game of 2023, let me start with that. I've been waiting for a hockey blitz sort of game for forever, so don't let the thumbs down fool you, I will be playing this game.  The difficulty varies wildly. Going from 3 pushover games to the refs who cheat (every round) and then the girls who have 5 players with full abilities is straight up not fun. The difficulty on my first run was so easy, I stomped and blew out every game until the girls. Everything since then has been a slog. Now I'm hardstuck at the knights with the scrawny laser shooter, and I've gone through 5 times now. It's just annoying to put us against an immovable wall without any attributes or stuff unlocked and expect us to keep doing it to grind up our attributes or whatever until we're good enough to get past ACT 2.   The difficulty can and should go up, but it should go up after a successful run or clearing of the act. Right now I'm trying my best to have fun but I need rubber to have fun and I can only 'farm' like 25 per run before getting hit with super unfun mechanics that my squad is not prepared for. I can do the cleanest shots and crosses and they will be blocked, CONSTANTLY, by the 6th ref or by the largest goalie I've ever seen.   AI isn't great, the amount of times my star players will just stand in front of the opponents net watching the puck go around the back is rage inducing. Often times I'll notice my attackers just hanging out on the opposite side of the ice when we're on defense. Just little stuff that adds up when putting a game into early access.  Still playing, will change my review when the game gets better. For now I'm going to do exhibition matches with my friends and wait for yall to fix the 'roguelike' stuff. Honestly, ngl, don't take this the wrong way dev team, but this game would be 10/10 if you took the roguelite crap and made them into random power ups you could pick up during the game and just had a normal franchise mode. But that's just me.",0

137948637,1494420,"This game has potential in it, and I look forward to seeing what it may become. With that said, this game is not yet in a place worth playing. It has it's fair share of small problems. But of course it's the big problems that matter, so I'll talk about those. The harveter. The human collection unit. It is the most important unit in the game for the humans, and it is GARBAGE! It couldn't crest and ant hill, and we're on a DESERT PLANET! It can't get to the resource nodes, and that means it can't make you money. The better your economy the larger your war machine.   Despite going multiple periods of 10 minutes fiddling around with the harvesters to get them to a resource node, we somehow didn't loose though. We should have, but the AI didn't send any large force against us, it just trickled in 3-4 units at a time. which 1 rocket truck and 2 armored cars could mostly deal with. This cause the game to be long and feel empty and soulless.   Once I had finally got the harvesters to collect from nodes they could reach on there own, I built up a small (by rts standards) offensive force to assault the enemy base. It consisted of 1 of every vehicle out of the heavy vehicle building, but I switched a hover tank for an extra rail gun tank. And I had an ultra heavy tank, which at the time, was being controled by my friend. This directly leads into my next point.   A small crab slipped past my rocket truck and into my base. It was on a refinery as the assault convoy moved past. I instructed my friend not to fire, because I had riflemen moving in to take care of it, and I wasn't sure if you could friendly fire building yet. That didn't stop the rail gun tanks though, and they launched an ungiuded rocket salvo while sitting under the ultra heavy tank, and damaged the entire convoy. It brought the ultra heavy down by 1/4 health. Friendly fire needs to be disabled. Atleast for ai controlled units. Stupid shit like this that you have no control over is the exact reason why all the other RTS's I've ever played don't have friendly fire.  TLDR; Harvester suck poo poo. The game as it is now feels empty. Friendly fire is a no no for me.",0
137947196,1494420,"Fix the harvesters, first. Do nothing else. Put the green stuff away, it's ruining your brains. There is absolutely no way you played four games in a row where the resource gathering system for 1/2 of your teams worked properly. Everything after that is balancing and optimizing. The game is broken as it is, fully. Stop working on new content, stop working on map design, stop working on player weapons, fix the harvesters. You do that, the game is working more or less and you can stop irritating your early access supports and focus on polishing it.",0

There's also a questionable design decision where any enemies you kill can just get back up whenever, so it makes you feel like you're wasting your ammo and punished for backtracking/exploring.  Apart from those two quibbles, it's a quality VR title. Looks and runs great, gun has a good tactile feel and genuinely scary, even if it is an over-reliance on jump scares. A bit short but also quite reasonably priced, so happy w/ the purchase.",1

137949118,1269300,"I cannot recommend the game as it is right now , yes this is a combination of FTL and OVERCOOKED , its fun at start but quickly gets super repetitive , also , the difficulty curve is just ridiculous , everything feels unbalanced and if you win or not is determined by RNG/Luck , overall could be good if they rework a few things and add more ''control'' over the ship upgrades.",0
137946995,1269300,"If you read reviews that tell you it's anything like FTL, don't. The comparison starts and ends at the visuals of battles. it desperately needs a lot more time in the oven  Repairing is nonsensical (whatever the damage on a wall is whether it's a huge hole or a tiny scratch from an explosion it all takes the same amount of time to repair and both use an entire repair kit). all this add up to a singular explosion slightly damaging 5 object being extremely unfun to face against and a much bigger threat than an actual entire part of your ship being blown off  The first level is a complete drag to get through with absolutely no challenge so half the crew can just sit out for 10 minutes at the begining of every game, complete disrespect of our time. The event missions are a complete joke too. There is little variety or originality to them so get ready to do the exact same boring mini-game over and over again.  The encounters too are very repetitive (with the same bosses at the end of every level) while the normal fights use the same few ships layouts over and over again so once you find which wall to break has the most impact on the enemy there's no reason to not ever always do that same thing.  I hope to see updates and improvement to this game in the future because it seems like a lot of the content is gated behind extremely dull and repetitive gameplay, not anything you want in a party game.",0

137950526,1375900,"Have to agree to a lot of the negative reviews. The general gameplay basis is a fun idea that sets itself apart a bit from the other games that do the same. However, upgrades are often buffing one thing a bit but debuffing it at the same time a lot. So for example you get a plus of cooldown reduction for something of 15% but at the same time reduce damage of that weapon by 20%. The numbers arent exact, because i cant be bothered to make a list here. But generally the upgrades feel less valuable that way, especially for weapons. In fact, the best buffs you get are through passive abilities, not weapon upgrades anyway. So for example the ""Lucky Charm"" increases crit chance but also has the ability to have enemies explode every Xth crit, which is a great pick. The Arsenal has not only healing effects, but also increase projectile counts, ranges and later adds an additional attack for all weapons.  Meanwhile weapon upgrades go like: Improve X, but make this and this worse. There are very few upgrades that just improve your attacks, like Blades getting plus in range or crit chance. All the others take something away when improving.  A few upgrades even feel pointless, like burn. Burn could generally be a good buff in any game, but in this game theres no range, all enemies are melee swarming you and your weapons are so short ranged, that applying burn doesnt give a lot of damage. It goes basically like this: You trigger enemies to spawn lets say 4 ingame metres from your character, your weapon range is 3,5 metres, until the enemy reaches you its dead, well or in your face anyway. So of what use could burn be? Yeah, melting ""sponges"", aka tanky enemies. There are none and even if there were, they would annoy the hell out of you.  I think upgrades like burn are contradictory to the games design. Except maybe, if they add an AoE Flamethrower weapon to the game. Yet, weapon damage is so high, most enemies just die from the first attack.   Overall, theres also too less content. One mode, two characters that arent that much different anyway, a few meta buffs that not only need you to excessively grind, but also arent giving you much of an improvement. I needed about 3 hours to gain 300 shards, one upgrade can take up to 250 shards. These upgrades are also sadly limited in count. So for example, you can buff your projectile amount by 1, so you perform with every weapon a double attack. But you can only purchase this upgrade once. Upgrades are separated by categories, limited to like 3 upgrades each. You can not buy 3 points in one category and then pump them into one ability. That would be majorly fun, because then you could try out different builds. Want to perform 3 bonus attacks? Cool, spend 3 points on the ability, but miss out on the other two of that category (cooldown and damage). Want to become tanky? Invest 3 into max life but miss out on speed. Not possible and thus limited.   The game demands quite a price for not offering a lot. I paid 6,39€ and it feels like too much. Other games tend to go cheaper but offer far more variety, depth and content.  Its a good game, its fun, but misses too much right now in terms of content.  If you consider the fact that Brotato was cheaper and able to entertain me for over 80 hours and potentially more, Swarm Grinder only entertained me for roughly 4 hours and will maybe for 1 more, until im bored of it. The term ""Grinder"" also is leaning to the bad side here, as i needed possibly 20 hours playtime to fully progress the meta upgrades, but they arent worth even half that time, as they arent mixing gameplay up enough.  With a few more modes, substantially different characters (see Brotato for really good ideas) and a drastical change to upgrades and meta progression, this could be a really good game, right now though, its just meh and other far better games are cheaper on top.",0

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1] An auto battler with roguelike elements where you try to survive waves of enemies for an amount of time till the boss comes along. Your goal is to beat the boss. Which sounds easier than it is. On the main page you can upgrade various skills that apply to all characters, as during the battle you can select from a random present a weapon, magic or alchemy item to help and benefit you.  [h1]Visuals:[/h1] Fun! A bit cartoonish. I personally like the style.  [h1]Sound:[/h1] Not bad as far as I’m aware, but honestly I haven’t heard that much about it since these types of games are glorious to combine with a podcast or other things you can listen to too. So guess what I did.   [h1]Controls:[/h1] Keyboard and mouse and normally controller but when I wanted to give it another try due a patch, before writing this review it refused to work and I don’t feel like playing with keyboard/mouse since I’m a controller baby.  [h1]Issues:[/h1] There are some but for me the biggest one is that it feels very grindy and a tad unbalanced. This makes it so that the gameplay doesn’t feel rewarding like some others of its genre. After today's patch my controller just didn’t work any more, that still works perfectly in another game after a quick check to see if it wasn’t a problem with my controller.  But I’m sure that’ll get fixed again. (Edit: Developer fixed this soon after my review.)  [h1]Closing word:[/h1] With a developer active working on it, I believe it has potential. I really like the cartoony gimmicky look of it. And surely it’s still a long road that will go paired with falling and getting back up. But it’s only in early access and I do have the feeling the developer listens to the input of the players. At this time I cannot recommend it, but having unexpectedly found a genre I find myself fond of in these types of auto battler games, I am happily willing to keep an eye on this one and follow up progress. I will revisit it occasionally to see how it’s going and how it’s doing and perhaps who knows my review may change overtime.  With love, Tchii [quote]I received the product for free.

There is no refund in skills and reroll if way over priced, making it a minmaxing game to get somewhere with no room to experiment and to fool around.  skills and perks ar restricked to 3 classes and each only have 5 skills. it optimal to get one set but without rerolls its a rng fest. minimum is 4 out of 5, but anything less and you will fall behind.  Upgrades are collectively linked so if you infest in skill A skill B, C and D wil also get more and more expencive. making your first win worth about 10 upgrades over all but quickly falls down to 1 or 2. a win.  The mission system is nice and the shop too. althou i wish i could genereate the money to actualy use it. Mission are simeple, just kill X amount of mob X or get a skill level to X. but with out reroll it can take some tries (again) Cause you have to get the skill and be strong enough to get it to max level. killing mobs is not level bound so you can do it spread over multipul levels but it can be unclear on where to kill them. (but there are only 3 levels so it not that hard to find out) The shop offers rare cards that can drop in the level. some offer nice bonuses. but the money is better invested in to passive perks. those offer a fixed amound of bonus all the time, instead of random chance a rare card drops in a level, let alone being a card you can use with your build..",0

Had fun with my buddies. Then, the problems started. Minor stuff: Poor hit detection with melee. Enemies invulnerable to attacks. Enemies persisting and attacking after 'death'. Falling through random terrain.  Bigger issues: AI needs a complete rework. Some of the worst I've ever seen in a first person shooter. Random drops to 3-4 FPS turning the game into a painful slide show.  Game breaking: Then, after actually having a really fun series of fights with some bosses, I login the next day for some solo play just for all legendary items, level progress and mission progress, to be reset or completely gone.  I got it for free and the price is still too high. I'm going to buy my buddies some sympathy lunches.",0

The setting feels quite immersive, the characters are cool and the world is big enough to offer a decent potential for exploring. A few tweaks and fixes are all it takes to get the show on the road.

No longer do you have to only pick 3 specializations, instead, you pick tomes as you go. This in turn, lets you build the exact kind of Godir you want.  The gameplay has been incredibly smooth, minus frame drops on multiplayer after ending turn.   I have played on multiple difficulties and they all felt pretty distinct from each other. Easy was grab some pretzels, recline, and enjoy the domination. Hard mode is more like you ask them to spit on it first.  The graphics are beautiful. The level of detail is astonishing.

It plays much like the OG NHL games (besides the power-ups, which can be turned off). It also runs flawlessly on Steam Deck.  With that, I'd like to give some feedback. First, I feel there needs to be more difficulty settings to fine tune the difficulty. Currently, Medium is too easy, while hard is more challenging but not overly difficult. Also, I'd love to see the option to turn ""offside"" and ""Icing"" on for when you want to play a more regulated game!  Overall great work and I highly recommend the game",1

I didn't have any issues with the gameplay aspects of the game, it's solid. The music ranges from ok to good, nothing really memorable, but nothing bad either. I think the artstyle is nice. The Finnish mythology aspect was the major selling point for me, it's very underutilized especially in the realm of gaming. As a person who has experience with retro games I managed to beat this in 2 hours. I enjoyed the time I spent with the game and felt like I got my money's worth, although I did get the -25% introductory discount.

137954102,1494420,"its the first game i've gambled on in early access for years.  i have a few other titles that are early access, but i know the devs on the projects, and they are dilligent in completing their projects from past experiences, so those aren't really risks.  regardless bohemia is known for its crisp gun battle in the ARMA series, nice UI's, the vehicles there are no slouch, and the frame rate is second to none. I can expect some of these features to come to Silica.  What it is - its a mixture of FPS and RTS. if you're a starcraft purist, you will hate it, dont buy it. if you're a call of duty warzone player only interested in first person shooter, give it a miss. if you like both, and played titles like C&C Renegade (or RENX), and to a much lesser extent Savage 2 (the janky project that was killed by cheating and a toxic community)  you might think 'well a game like executive commander is already complete and polished' - ya but only if you want singleplayer or limited co-op. I'm not bashing on exec com - but this game allows the commander to both place structures  and build units, [u]and it allows the player infantry to take control of any unit on the field.[/u]  this game has barely gotten started and its top 50 in the best sellers. Why is this?  1- high level of functionality 2- no other games challenging this space. being honest here, this is SUPER difficult to pull off. many have tried and failed, this one might, as well. but the foundation is pretty firm on this so far.  there's a ton of issues with the game, it is an early beta, but just reading some features that are planned, they're going to be going all out to refine this experience.  anyways, if early access already burnt your fingers and you're reluctant, don't buy in. cancel it right there.  if you're willing to take the risk + accept that its going to crash and stuff isn't going to work properly for a good long time, roll the dice on that 20 bucks and support the development of an awesome title.

137954000,1494420,"I know that the game is in early access, but here is my feedback.  I want to start off with the graphics and sound design. The graphics are awesome; it looks super-dope, and I don't think anyone would call them bad in any way. It's not like Red Dead Redemption 2 graphics, but this is also a completely different game. However, sound quality is on a completely different level. The sounds the rail gun tank makes when it fires are godlike. It's the most aggressive rail gun to date.  Gameplay is pretty good but lacking. I know this will change as the game updates, but for now, we need some quality-of-life upgrades. They need to add a zoom mechanic for the FPS mode. When you are in a vehicle or playing as the Aliens, you can't zoom. This kinda breaks the idea of having a big map since the max range gets crippled by the lack of zoom mechanics.  It would also be cool if you could, for example, see the range of your units marked by a big circle around them when you select them as the RTS player. Here's another free idea: make it so we can choose which barracks we spawn in instead of it being random. This really annoyed me when playing as the Aliens since their playstyle is to spread across the map. That meant if you had an Aliens unit you really wanted to play as in another base, you would have to respawn until you, by a random chance, respawned in the right base.  Also, I know they will add more units, but as it is right now, the Aliens need something that can keep up with the heavy tanks. Also also i know the story takes place on a desert planet, but we more maps with more variety.",1

137953824,2211730,"This game is very close to perfect in my opinion. After maybe an hour and a half in, everything suddenly clicked and I was flying all over the place killing everything - the best modern arena shooting experience since Doom Eternal, couldn't recommend this game enough",1
137952240,1269300,"Review as of 07/05/23  Hello viewer. I had purchased this game with the intent to evaluate the single player experience, although I have joined the discord and occasionally dabbled in multiplayer which was also good fun. Having now completed several runs on the normal difficulty (although hard mode still alludes me) I wanted to write a positive review, as what is here is nice.   As an avid fan of FTL games, I have followed almost all the inspired releases, of which most have failed. For example from memory although the names escape me, I vaguely remember two other co-op FTL games that died within weeks of release, because they were multiplayer only and had failed to garner a community. While there is a small community in discord and it's possible to get some games with others going - It highlights why having an adequate single player mode is important, and the games own spin and added mechanics keeps things interesting.   I was initially frustrated that it felt like you couldn't just outslug the enemy like you could in FTL (AKA do enough disabling damage before your shields / evasion fails you) as enemies quickly outscales you in number of weapons and equipment. However it caused me to think and began to understand how the game design's intent is to instead, create gaps /space in the enemies through different weapon properties, AOE damage etc to allow down time to repair in battle. I also appreciate how priority targets on the enemy ship isn't constant sometimes. (EG FTL kill weapons + shields always) Here an opportunity might present itself where enemy pawns end up in positions where blowing out the wall vents the entire crew. A nice addition which is a great giggle. Overall I applaud good balance offered here which isn't like most of the FTL games.   Postives:  - Being able to shoot out walls to vent and kill nearby crew is a great new tactical option. - Relics (Let's call them that) upgrades, and weapon rarity are a fresh addition to the formula.  - Crew AI is in a ""workable"" state. After getting familiar enough you can play around and anticipate what AI crew will do to optimise play. I can see how some small, non-complicated tweaks that could further improve it. __________  I will preface this here now that, while the below negative section might sound bad. I still recommend the game and think the experience even for a solo player is worth it.  __________  Negatives: - Visuals and tone of the game I dislike, feels like too many FTL games bar Trigon recently has gone with the cartoony joke style and I'm bored of it by now. I personally would want a more serious artstyle and tone, not necessarily realistic either.  - The game isn't designed for solo play. ***  *** As much as I like what's going on here, I have to acknowledge that in the end it has left me wanting more. More of which, I don't believe the game would be able to provide me because of how the game is built. As I know the dev team consists of two people, and therefore is balanced around co-op play. The vast majority of non-combat events are clearly two player or more oriented (AI crew cannot do events outside of repair ones) causing me to choose to decline most of them on hard difficulty (is tight to do on normal). Unless the dev team wishes to spend a huge amount of time disabling some events creating single player only ones I don't see this being an experience that is enjoyable for solos. (Yes they are doable although tight, but is it fun when you know the events were designed with two players in mind?)  Then there is the scope of the game. It just feels limited. With runs lasting under 2hrs from start to finish you can tell it was designed as a quick evening couch game. You only ever have 2 guns with 5 additional spare slots of equipment. You can only ever get baseline + 1 rarity of whatever sector your in. You can't get those killer runs like in FTL where you find say a Vulcan gun early or triple burst laser 2s, and just feel like a god utterly ripping apart everything. The RNG is constrained in a way to keep the game balanced but ultimately limited in power fantasy.   This game has a good framework that I would want developers to take note of. In the future if another FTL game designer is to come along, I would like them to take what's here design it from the ground up as a single player experience. Longer, larger ships, longer experiences and more of everything.  Summary: Multiplayer: Great. Single player: Passable good.",1

137954091,1375900,"there are moments of fun here, and this has to be one of the best looking games in this genre yet, but most runs tend to devolve into a slog in which you don't have enough DPS to chew through the swarms unless you get into overload mode--and because the fuel pick-ups will probably expire before, y'know, you maneuver the swarm away from them and are able to actually pick them up without dying, you probably won't be able to. you also rely so much on the random drops actually suiting your build (sometimes you'll basically have one real option, since the other two will conflict with your current build at the time).  there are A LOT of cool, fresh ideas here, and there is A LOT of potential with this--but, as is, it is just too dreary and mind-numbing too often.

Once the workaround was enabled the game works fine so I assume this will be patched soon.  Sad that it launched broken but c'est la ve.  Giving it some charitability beyond that so far and I am stunned by the changes from AoW3 > AoW4 so far.  I think I might have seen some of them coming if I were thinking about how Stellaris has changed over time since this is also a Paradox game but all in all I am happy with the changes so far and the more serious tone of the game.  I did really really like the campy and goofy tone of AoW1 and AoW2/AoW2: SM, but I recognize that with how pretty games can get, like this one, it might be time to leave that behind and I'm glad they seem to have so far.  I look forward to playing more and seeing more, this is one of my fav 4X franchises of my entire life so I'm a little biased obvi lol.",1

AoW games have always had impressive tactical combat, but this expands and enhances the strategic element to be more Civ like, and it's been a lot of fun so far (38 hours).

We found that calling our scout units that were set to auto scout back seemed to help with this.

137958324,1566200,"Tape to Tape answers the question of ""what if slay the spire was goofy hockey instead of a card game?"".   Overall, it's really good so far for being in early access. The actual hockey mechanics feel really good, with movement having the right amount of momentum and poke and body checking feeling fun and fair and shooting feeling controllable but just a little bit random. Sometimes it kinda feels like mario strikers but hockey, with players randomly body checking each other and then you dribble up the rink and everyone else is on the ground, which is really fun. Your goalie can be a bit stupid sometimes but the devs are working on it and just made him better, which is nice.  The artefacts and talents that you get from winning games are pretty creative and interesting. I especially enjoy the combo of tomahawk and the one that gives you 2 extra sticks, so you can throw 3 sticks at your opponents and knock them over. I also really like the combo of all the talents that give your player extra checking but take away his stick, and he just runs around and punches everyone and it feels really good. I like that the starting skill pool starts off pretty small until you unlock and purchase them between runs, letting you get used to each skill instead of being overwhelmed. Overall, I think the artefacts and talents and skills are great so far, and I look forward to the new ones the devs eventually make.  The opposing teams you play are really really cool, too. Each one has a unique theme and unique skills and abilities that change how you have to play against each of them. When you play the refs, for example, they always win faceoffs because they cheat, so you have to be a bit more defensive I think. I especially enjoyed the crusaders and the mountaineers and their unique abilities. Eventually, I would like to see some more teams so you don't play almost exactly the same teams every run, but that's not a big deal right now considering early access.  I also think the aesthetic of the game is great, with the sound effects being really good and the soundtrack being decent. I like the songs that play in each arena when you score. The art style is really clean and fun. The dialogue is usually pretty funny and I really like the subtle humor in the names of the arenas or the characters like Gawain Guretsky  There are a few things I don't like, but I think the devs are working on it based on the last patch notes.      - There are still a few bugs with animations being stuck or the puck kinda going out of bounds for a little while and then landing back in the rink      - Sometimes when I'm losing and the other team scores, it's really frustrating to not be able to skip through my opponent's victory dance thing      - Greasy Lettuce annoys me, Calvin Dord is too good      - The refs still feel a bit too strong. I feel like if I can beat the refs in a run, I have a really good chance of beating the rest of the game. It's also really annoying when one of my goals just gets cancelled because the refs can cheat.  Overall, I really like Tape to Tape, and I recommend it to anyone who likes goofy sports games, hockey, or roguelites. It's already in a pretty good state for being in early access, and I look forward to seeing what the devs do with it going forward.",1

137957065,1494420,"Ah, the game looks pretty and I would say that it could potentially be a very fun game, but in its current state it is VERY EARLY access. I've completed 1 round with Commander and 1 with Soldier.  Commander: If you're expecting an RTS experience, well, uh, I guess it technically is that, but if you have any prior RTS experience there really isn't much of anything to play here in terms of RTS. At the start of game, scout enemy base, send starting units, win. If the enemies are players who will actually put up anything of a fight you might have to actually use some production buildings to make more units, but there is nothing more than that to do in micro or macro terms.   - Pathfinding fails HORRIBLY in certain areas of the map, making it almost impossible to move the units. You may find yourself giving a move order to move units closer to enemy base, but the pathfinding will yeet the move order waaay off, sometimes even getting units stuck in between resource fields and cliffs.  - The Light quads are great for early scouting the enemy base, but they can shoot on the move and they move fast, so really unless you're ready for them a Commander with but 10 APM can keep them safe while they alone destroy a whole base within a few minutes.  - Troop formations aren't implemented yet, so you have to move the riflemen individually if you wanna set up some cool screenshot formations, but that doesn't really matter mechanically, make Death Blob of 10ish units, send to base, win again  - Unit Teleporter can be used by players to teleport anywhere on the map where there is vision of the area, so friendly units or Radar Station vision, this is great for the Soldier experience of players, but in the current state of the game is absolutely broken balance wise that the squad of a few rifleman that can win the game can near instantly teleport back and  keep up the siege.  - Clicking on the minimap to move camera view de-selects the current unit selection, imo this should not be  - Double-clicking a unit control group does not move camera view to group  - There is no visible indication of control groups, but they do work for quick selection of units (Ctrl+(number), (number) to recall group)  - There can be only 1 Harvester, which spawns with the first Refinery you build (the only building you can build at start of game), but if you build a new Refinery, the old Harvester will disappear even if it has a load of resources collected making you lose whatever its carrying\  - enemy AI Commander does not prioritise base defence under siege, meaning that if there aren't any soldier units around, the AI will keep trying to scout the map (or whatever non-sensible course of action it was doing) instead of surviving and putting up a fight  - A single resource collector means that early destruction of this collector can easily bankrupt a team into being unable to continue playing. It's already too easy to just move up and destroy a base, this makes it even more so as destroying the enemy's entire economy hangs on a single unit  Soldier:  - It looks pretty, movement is okay, boringly simple gameplay. Again if you have decent enemy players it could be okay as far as the rough balance state of units is, but ultimatively it boils down to same as Commander's view - find enemy base, hold mouse button until there is no base. The starting soldier untis of the enemy might make it a bit fun, but being able to move and shoot with no drawbacks makes it a very small challenge.  - There is no reload animation (gun goes to low ready stance, bullets show up, not much of a reload animation)  - If you fuck around and wait for research to finish you can play with some more toys, but if you just play the game and go fight the enemy, it's hard to get research done with the lack of challenge",0
137956725,1494420,"This is the absolute skeleton of what COULD be a great game.   For those considering purchasing, this game is super barebones at the moment. There are only two ""playable"" gamemodes, and an extra mode which seems to just be for testing. The strategy mode, which is a blend of RTS and FPS mechanics, is difficult to learn strictly because of the state of the UI, and I didn't get to experience all of it (however, I was playing solo, and it seems to be geared toward multiplayer.)   The models look really good though. There aren't many finished animations and the other ones have physics issues, such as when you shoot one of the aliens and kill it, the running animation just pauses and it slides forward about ten feet before ragdolling.  The guns don't have reload animations, instead opting for a ""cooldown"", but there is no indicator of this happening except for a small bar on the crosshair, which leads me to believe this might be a work-in-progress reload animation.  All the ""unfinished business"" aside, this has the potential to be a great game, but I can't recommend it in this state, even for $20. You won't get much enjoyment out of it until new updates come out. But if you wish to support the development and lock in a cheaper price, go for it. I'll personally be waiting for things to get a bit more fleshed-out.",0

137956175,1368890,"I played the game outside of steam, before buying it here.   This is what I expressed after seeing the screenshots and trailer :  This sort of freedom in concept and game development kind of reminds me of PS2 games. It's a nice throwback. I like when devs just enjoy creating what they create, for themselves. Although I realize that my second statement is more geared towards dev experience nowadays, since, back then, people had a lot to lose for simple creations. Shows how much more passion there used to be. I'm beggining to see some of that passion ever so gently creeping back in through the indie world of games.  After around an hour of playing :  I'm loving it. The atmosphere is mysterious and void (I managed to glimpse the outside of the map), while delivering synchronous sounds to the landscape. A real dreamscape. Thank you  After a few hours : ﻿ I haven't gotten the chance to try the flashlight, or, find the phone, or the ghost kid, although, I enjoy it for the presence it brings. I would've REDACTED the game by REDACTED it, but, given that it's just a dreamscape, although well made, I can't REDACTED to REDACTED the current REDACTED for it. I would gladly REDACTED the developer REDACTED as a thank you if there is a place for me to do that. :3  Some experience later :  The more I play, the more I notice little details. It's a very intelligent design.  As of now, I'm still enjoying it. The phone, ATM, and, VERY IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS, don't really grab my attention, since, I've already learned to enjoy the dreamscape.   I find myself walking, and exploring a lot.   And sometimes I stay still, taking in the meaninglessness of it all.   It's beautiful.  P.S. I'm eager to play with VR. If I can afford it in the future.     Edit :   I wanted to venture into the meaning of the phone, documents and whatnot, and, to be honest, I hesitated at first, since, I had a hunch that it would be a game of cat and mouse that never ends. Curiosity got the best of me though, and I went down the path of restlesness. It was tiresome, and meaningless, just as it already is.   Helpful for the minds that can't stop seeking. I appreciate that. For me too.   I preffered the void over the water. Kind of makes it less mysterious.",1

From what I've seen online, it's largely an issue with how the game interacts with certain drivers (which is why some people will not experience crashes and others will). In the team's credit, they are aware of the issue and working on it actively. However in the meantime I can't justify the $50 price tag for an experience that has me crashing every 30 minutes :(  I'll likely come back later once the game is much more stabilized!

137959239,1566200,"So close yet so far away!  Tape to Tape is a modern take on NHL 94, it's got some great gameplay and the graphics/animations are really well done! Unfortunately, Tape to Tape experience becomes diluted very quickly once you've played a few exhibition games and finished a few campaign runs. I totally get trying to go a different route by making the campaign a roguelite experience however it becomes stale incredibly quick with not much else left to do. I won't recommend this game because it seems the devs don't have much interest in adding a season/gm/franchise mode. Without any of those options this game is a nice car without wheels, the gameplay is great but the boring roguelite being the only gameplay mode (other than exhibitions) is very disappointing. Once a franchise/season/GM mode is added I will forever recommend this game. The replay value would be endless! As of today the game feels like a polished demo and the devs seem more focused on maintaining the Tape to Tape aesthetic than making a fun hockey game with lots of gameplay.",0

In this game, which provides an isometric Doom experience, we progress by grinding the aliens surrounding us in a claustrophobic environment, and as we develop, we can get permanent perks.  The two biggest factors that make the game feel like Doom are the art design and the great soundtrack!  Color palettes are well used. Even though I'm colorblind, I didn't have any problems with the HUD.  Edit: I followed the advice of the game maker and tried 3 passive and 2 active, but I got stuck at mine 17. 3 active and 2 passive can be the right way. Try to find your own strategies :)  Finally: Helicopter Helicopter is the best skill ever!  -TR:  Eğer Vampire Survivors ya da Brotato'yu sevdiyseniz bu oyunu düşünmeden deneyin.

137965479,1550010,"So I really wanted to like this game. The trailer got me really excited. And while I am aware it's Early Access, it is truly a mess.  Let's start with the fact that even for an early access game it is extremly bugged. Villagers are T-posing, floating around instead of walking, the performance is simply bad. I played Early Access-Games that were already a lot of fun and had some great features. Now I didn't play for long. Because the performance is so bad and I disliked the overall look, the ugly movements of the villagers and the main character, but this was honestly enough. Sitting at the hairdresser and not even being able to see my character from the front, not being able to rotate the camera. In the clothes store you can't even have a look at the clothes you buy and they don't look good at all. NPCs do not move at all while talking to them. No movements of the mouth and they rather look robotic than human. And don't let me start on the controls and how laborious everything feels.  Besides that the game comes across as rather cheap. While it looks so beautiful on the screenshots, it feels so empty and actually not that pretty at all. But I guess that is a question of taste.  Maybe in a few years I'll take another look into the game and actually give it more of a chance. But right now it's not worth it for me.  Conclusion: It feels more like an Early Alpha than Early Access.",0
137965805,1294810,"This reminds me of Generation Zero, but you are fighting vampires and cultists instead of robots. I have only had 1 bug, which exited my game in 2.9 hours of play. I don't know if I will have anymore, but it still not that bad. Yes, this is subject to change the more I progress.  Things I liked: 1.) Open world. 2.) Map. 3.) Some open buildings. 4.) Resources. 5.) Infinite Ammo crates spread across the map. 6.) Weapons are good, the UV light and stake shooter.  Things that need fixing. 1.) Bugs. 2.) More weapons, different types. 3.) More open buildings. Most of them are closed off. Could have been far better if all of them were open.",1
137965632,1294810,"If you come into the game wanting non-stop combat as a key element, it won't really be what you're looking for. Approach the game the way it's presented—a town to explore that was torn apart from the inside so you need to fight to save its remaining community, with oodles of environmental storytelling bolstered by PC and enemy dialogue—and you should have a better time.  Redfall is a town beset by vampires and their cultists, but the situation had built up over time—weeks of neighbors acting strange, people going missing. That's why it's desolate, houses boarded up, shops shuttered.  This isn't a town dense with corpses turned undead. It's a town devastated by people turning on their community, sacrificing neighbors to a couple people in power. Yes, there's space between fights—because untold numbers of townies are gone, or left dead in the streets. If you take the time to look while you run around, there's a TON of crafted environmental elements underlining all that. So many notes, items, and corpses indicating clear, unique moments throughout the town.  I personally find the space between enemy groups a boon, because even while playing solo, you can't pause. So it's nice to be able to find an empty area to hide when a brief break is needed, without having to go back to a safehouse. And yeah, the game's got bugs—but what big game doesn't on launch? There's too many moving parts at this scale, within the game and for folks' respective setups. I personally haven't had anything game-breaking, so while I look forward to patches, I'm having fun poking around Redfall and figuring out just what the hell these vampire gods did.  Aesthetically, characters are stylized rather than hyper-realistic, which I personally prefer. It helps to avoid the uncanny valley 3d is prone to, and prevents looking “dated” as quickly because the exaggerations are deliberate. I would like if there were some way to get a little voiced banter with the other PCs while playing solo, because I LOVE all the characters. But it's also fun reading the color-coded notes on the whiteboards, and Devinder's solo commentary is absolutely AMAZING on its own, so I am well entertained.",1
137965551,1294810,"Very first impressions. If you enjoyed Dishonored you will enjoy RedFall albeit in a different manner. The game is playable, 7900XTX 60/70 fps on Epic quality without FSR. The game, IMO, need low level tweaking since I can observe notorious 'VRAM leaking', you start your play with 11GB of VRAM used and with FPS in the high 80's/low 90's and end the session with quite near 15GB VRAM used and FPS in the mid 70's, quite a loss. Perhaps a lot of money for (again) a half baked game, but playable (and quite enjoyable so far), nonetheless. I will update my review at around 20h",1
137963990,1294810,I wanted to like the game but between the fps spikes and the animation of npc the one thing that killed it for me was i completed all side mission and main mission and when i finished the campaign i was expecting some type of end game but nope they just have you do the same thing over again just on the max difficulty if you want to do it but playing it that was for the first time was a bore i was only hoping for some type of end game mechanic to grind with but just got shit 69.99 is not worth if all it has is a story based game with no end game mechanic maybe i would change my rating if they would implement some type of endgame mechanic.,0
137963920,1294810,"It's an ""OK"" game. Not a great game. I've heard that it has some major performance issues... I am yet to meet any of those. Stable fps all maxed at 1440p. However i do play it on 3090+11900KF. Not many people have that setup. In my opinion it is not worth the full-price.

The two classes that are available at the time of this writing are vastly different from one another and both very viable and fun in their own way. The necromancer, in particular, is very different from most classes you'll get in most games like this.   I enjoy the arc where each class seems weak until you figure out how to make it work, at which point you can't imagine your life as anything else.   In terms of power-ups, this has a lot going on. Each class has a couple different directions you can take a build in. I have strong preferences as to what I prefer, which I like. Beats being indifferent to the choices you're presented with. And this preference is based solely on my personal play style and not one direction being more powerful than the other. If the RNG pushes me in a different direction, I can make it work and it'll still be fun despite not being what I envisioned when I loaded into the run.   Then in terms of levels, there are only 2 right now, but they're both interesting. I've gotten far enough to see events (that I won't spoil) on both and they're quite different. There are also things that happen to me on individual levels that don't happen every time, making me feel like there are secrets to be discovered, which is interesting.   All that being said. 2 classes. 2 levels. Obviously more is coming, but I'm surprised by how much is here already and I'm really looking forward to seeing how this all progresses.   I would also like to express interest in expanding the class leveling system a bit. I've played the game for 3 hours, and I'm just about maxing out the classes that are there. It'd be fun to have a more expansive skill tree to work on over time. Maybe even a big enough tree where it's not a given that you'll eventually unlock and max out everything.",1

The differences are pretty much how many individual units the player has to deal with.  By that I mean, the OOBs are the same, but they're represented differently on the map.  Also the naval aspect is simplified in the basic game.  I figure grognards are going to gravitate towards the advanced scenario versions, but they'll also enjoy the basic to get started.  The depth is the same for both versions, in terms of decision-making, strategies, tactics, weapon types, military doctrine.  Will you employ chemical weapons?  Deliver them by artillery?  Air strikes?  How will you handle tactical nukes.  How will such decisions impact whether the conflict escalates?    The developers have obviously been planning this game for a while - not only is the depth of research obvious, but just outright knowledge of the era.  They're not newcomers to the subject matter.

Went into a match against an *easy* AI, and could not land any attacks because the hitboxes are extremely off, the AI somehow always knew when to grab counter (on easy), never failed to land their grabs because grab cancels weren't in the tutorial, and the input detection is wonky as all hell, deciding to ruin quarter-circle inputs by dragging out the diagonal input three times over before finally deciding i had let go of the horizontal direction. I have played fighting games before, and I am perfectly capable of doing quartercircle inputs in them. When I played this it felt like I only landed quarter-circle inputs in this game when it felt like *allowing* me to land one.  The sprites are fine, the subject matter is fine, i don't care whether someone likes Vtubers or not. But the hitboxes and input detection is genuinely to worst I've personally experienced. When someone who goes through the tutorial to learn the control scheme and has played fighting games prior cannot beat an EASY AI even after going through the tutorial AGAIN and going into training to try to figure out a single low-difficulty character and their moves, then the game needs some kind of tuning.",0

137970894,1294810,"I wanted to like this game, since it checks off the usual interests - open world, supernatural, exploration, Autumn setting, characters with abilities.  Gave it a good 20 hours at time of review, to see if the lackluster introduction gave way to improvements. Even with few bugs, it's still been ""meh"" most of the time. Story hasn't been told in a way that got my attention (normally something I am very forgiving about), the environmental storytelling has been sparse for an open-world game, the human enemies all feel very samey. Boss fights have been lackluster.  The one part that has caught my attention at all is the Grave Locks you can find, but while it's the most interesting story element it's delivered piece meal through 2-3 sentence voiced lines from items you have to scour otherwise lackluster areas to find them all -and there's a lot of them. 100 to be exact, with no way to track the locations you've already searched, and no indicator of how many are in the first area and how many are in the second area (important thing to know for collecting, since you can't travel back to the first map without starting anew in NG+.

137969293,1294810,"Writing this review at about the 8 hours of play mark. All in all a good game. It isn't breaking the mold on anything but has a nice open feel without being too bloated. Multiplayer is straightforward. The performance is good with only a few issues like minor pathing issues for mobs, occasionally graphic hiccups, but nothing that has interfered with play-ability. Things I enjoy: The amount of world components that you can use to make combat more interesting. The simplicity of the mechanics and quest tracking. The pared down equipment and skill charts.",1
137969101,1294810,"I'm going to say that I recommend this game to players for the dream that it represents, not because of what is here... and I will elaborate on that first.  The Dream: Have you ever wanted to be a badass Vampire Hunter in a post-apocalyptic setting, gunning down hordes of Ghouls, Freaks, Vampires and the like? If that box is checked then this game is for you.  However:  And this is a strong one... due to the way the game is set up, I cannot recommend this for anyone who doesn't have an extreme hard-on for the idea of being a Vampire hunter... because of numerous bugs, one of the characters being basically useless (We'll get to this) and the game-progression/ general gameplay system being overly flawed (I will loosely explain this... but since its so new, y'know...)  Numerous Bugs: So sometimes vampires will just not attack and not be attackable... sometimes certain numbers glitch out, the party system will sometimes not work and if you don't play in Borderless Windowed Mode then the screen will essentially fuck up and you'll pretty much be screwed.  Broken Character: So Layla, the Psychic doesn't really feel all that Psychic... her first ability only affects humanoids... because they're the only one's shooting bullets... her basic passive increase point literally makes food items more potent (you can't pick up food for later)... rather than do something exceptional, like get more lock-picks or get more money or have a bigger health stack... her second ability is literally a aerial traversal skill that is beat entirely by another team member's (Devander's Teleporter), leaving her ulti... which isn't even a psychic power, the only really useful skill in her tool-kit. In a game where people have invisibility, teleportation, explosives and robots, would it of killed the dev's to give the psychic girl actual psychic abilities rather than dollar-store green lantern powers and a Vampire Boyfriend? I'm just saying... some things in her kit need a SERIOUS rework because the others can ez solo while she's lagging due to lack of utility.  Game Play/Progression: This is a serious one... Dev's, you better read this one CAREFULLY. It is 2023... we do not make a multiplayer game where a restart is required to play a specific section of a gameworld... fix it. Now. You are killing your fanbase before it begins... also, when you do fix it... and you know what I mean, since you put a literal ENDING in a multiplayer game... add some end-game content loop. Need inspiration? Look at skyrim, go play as an imperial and do nothing but collect rare gems, wealth and priceless artifacts and stick them in a chest... you will be BEYOND inspired to do some badass Vampire Hunter shit. Just saying.  Final Thoughts: What's here is fun... its great! But seriously... the things I listed, the negatives... they need to be addressed... and soon. I'm going to give this game the benefit of the doubt... I did pay 100$ for this game after all... but if things go sour, all I've got to say is that more love and care needed to go into making this game a more seamless and enjoyable game... because I also gifted it to someone for, yes, the same amount... I payed 200$ for this game with the hope and intention of it being good... so while I'll be patient and wait... I will seriously be considering how I spend my money in the future... as for the gameplay... don't finish the main quest till you get bored of the first area... and so on... You'll get a lot more hours out of the game.

After just finishing Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, I'm just so tired of playing fully priced games on release day and they're an unfinished mess.  TL;DR, gameplay is good, but crashes frequently enough to be a major problem.",0
137971941,1669000,"Fantastic game. Spent the whole bank holiday weekend playing it and enjoyed pretty much every hour. Probably one of the best 4x games I've played recently, even in it's current iteration.   Only issue I have currently is that the AI on the campaign map is SUPER dodgy and needs a bit of work. For example, I built an outpost and my ally AI parked a group of units on it. My outpost is now ""occupied"" and I can't do anything with it.  However, as this is my ally, if I attack them to get them to move I then break my alliance and go to war. Their units have been parked on my outpost for 20 turns and will not move. Other than that annoyance. The AI is just a bit stupid in general on the campaign map. Enemy AI is easy to outsmart and just stacks hordes of units together and your Ally AI is actually more of a hinderance.    Overall, a solid 8/10 so far. If they can tweak the AI and improve it's performance on the campaign map, this game will be one of, if not the best 4x game to come out in recent years.",1

137969772,2362120,"[i]Finding Hannah[/i] is a hidden object game that stands out through its slice-of-life story, impressive art style and a relatable protagonist. Hannah is going through a midlife crisis at her job while also trying to navigate her complicated relationship. She reaches out to other characters, seeking advice for her troubles and some help in finding herself.  Currently playable are only the first two and a half chapters, each containing five different locations, totaling to 4-5 hours of playtime. Clearing a scene will award you a certain amount of points, depending on how fast you find the objects and how accurate you are in clicking them. One location can and [i]must[/i] be played  multiple times, because of two reasons. The first few times you clear a scene, you’ll mostly get some story progression through a small cutscene involving Hanna interacting with the other characters. Subsequent clears of that location will instead award you items required for a minigame that you’ll have to complete in order to be able to unlock the next location.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972947222 This minigame functions as a [i]2048[/i] in which the elements are freely movable. The idea is to combine two items of the same type and level into a stronger item of one level above, then repeat this step until you reach the higher level objects (just like in 2048) as required by the quests given to you. When you finally manage to acquire enough points from completing these objectives, you’ll be able to spend those points on unlocking a new location which will offer new story bits and a combination of higher level drops for the minigame.  [i]2048[/i] is a fun game, but its main issue is that a lot of iterations are needed for creating higher level items. In [i]Finding Hannah[/i], the maximum level item is 10, and to be able to create it you will need exactly 2 ^ 10 = 1024 basic objects. Considering that you get a random and quite a small amount of objects each time to complete a scene (also depending on your performance), you’ll have to play a single location dozens of times if you want to progress. The more you advance in the game, the higher the requirements to complete quests are (most often encountered are two or three Level 8 items per quest) thus the more time you’ll spend grinding for these items.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972947196 Even though every time you play a scene there’s some novelty element because you get a random mechanic between finding objects based on their names / silhouettes / type and sometimes even new items or different positions for some of the items, sadly the game boils down to being extremely grindy and redundant. As a pass-timer it’s surely fine (completing a scene takes only a few seconds), but for those that dislike playing the same content over and over again, [i]Finding Hannah[/i]’s design could become frustrating and unenjoyable.  Considering that you currently get on average around ten mixed Level 1 and Level 2 objects per scene completion, the game could really benefit from being less stingy with the rewards. The story is nice to follow, but having to replay one level as many times as needed to gather hundreds of Level 1 and Level 2 items, then manually pairing them together in an incremental way really pushes one’s patience and ultimately decreases the fun. On the positive side, the scenes aren’t timed, stacking bonus points are awarded for finding objects quickly one after another, and you can also use up to three hints per scene, replenished every time you replay it. Additionally, the items are quite noticeable in the environment, without appearing glued on the background. Their art style is clean and minimalistic, making even their silhouettes easily identifiable.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972947171 Aside from being LGBTQIA+ inclusive, the game touches on political and historical themes from  the world’s history of the second half of the 20th century (with a strong focus on Germany’s): wars, feminism, environmentalism, etc. Out of the 32 levels that the full game plans to offer on release (which is currently scheduled for the end of 2023), only 12 are available at the moment of writing this review. Aside from a less restrictive reward system, the game could benefit from having some quality-of-life elements implemented (especially in the merge minigame), and also Steam achievements as a bonus.

137969517,1566200,"I don't have a lot of reviews but I feel pretty strongly about this one and this game so here goes.  I am a lifelong hockey player and player of video games. I started skating when I was 4 and started playing games not long after; I got a Sega Genesis for Christmas as a young boy, so yeah, I'm old.   Since then, I have played essentially every hockey video game on any form of console. I played in the OG LG NHL pro leagues in the XBOX 360 days. I would consider myself an expert when it comes to hockey games and hockey in general.  I have been dying for a legitimate PC hockey game for well over a decade now. Ever since EA discontinued NHL on PC (after NHL 2008), I have been waiting for a legitimate hockey title and online experience.  I haven't gotten that yet. There have been close ones, there are things that have scratched certain itches, but really nothing accessible has really wowed me.  There are ways to play older versions of EA NHL games that are modded with modern rosters and have serious competitors, but it takes a lot of work and the end result definitely leaves you wanting more.  Slapshot:Rebound is a really fun hockey-esque game, but in reality it's a pretty nuanced, bare bones game dressed up like hockey. Other than the gliding, it is more or less it's complete own thing.  To the real point, this is by far the best hockey game available on PC. It is not perfect, but it checks off about 75-80% of the boxes on my PC hockey game wish list.  It is an arcadey, cartoonish NHL 94 clone with power-ups, abilities and tons of charm. The story mode is super fun and, when played on expert mode, extremely challenging. It feels very difficult but not unfair.  I'm looking forward to the ability to play online head to head, but for now, finding matchups with people on the games community discord and playing head to head on remote play is plenty sufficient.   I had a great time playing co-op with some buddies and doing the campaign. We all got a good laugh out of the antics of the refs during the boss fight, just so much fun.  It is very clear that this game is made by someone with a deep love for hockey who is also quite clever. I love the names for the NPCS. Adam Gravy, Marc Scarpone, Doug Killmore. 10/10.  If you are a fan of hockey you should buy this game and support this developer.",1

137972397,1742020,"tl;dr As a fan game, it's cute. As a fighting game, it is too focused on offense and provides little support for defensive players  The game is snappy and doesn't limit the player offensively. If you can think of it, there's probably a way to do it. The game is very loose, and that's a good thing.  I mostly played Aki and was having a decent time labbing her and took her online to get a pretty decent win loss record, although I couldn't tell you what it is because that info doesn't appear to be viewable. The lobbies are horrendous but the actual online feel of the game is pretty good.  I feel some of the characters are mislabled as Aki is labeled as a zoner but has terrible projectiles and weird disjointed attacks. I feel, at least at this time, she is most effective as a mix up character. Her command normals are pretty good and Mukirose buttons feel good and lead to a ton of damage. She has no reversals though, so if you get hit, be prepared to block for the rest of your life, but good news, it won't last long. Her heavy TP is supposed to be invincible but I couldn't tell you when or how long because it's always getting stuffed. That may be a skill issue.  The game direction seems all over the place at times where sometimes I'm learning and having fun, and the next I'm struggling to understand the game mechanics, or rather why some things are the way they are.  For example, the game has a burst meter but you have to earn it. You don't start off with it and it's a little frustrating but I got over that pretty quickly. Also for as fast as this game is, I am shocked that there's not a push block or alpha counter of any type.  Currently this game rewards aggression in such a frustrating way. Defensive characters have to rely on their ability to block because the game does not reward you for good defense.   Assists, or Collabs in this game, are also tied to meter which make them kind of annoying to use and I often just ignore them. Also they cannot be used while other buttons are being pressed so they're mostly being used during wall bounce or hard knockdown.  The exception being that your Collabs also have supers and can be used easily mid combo. I think both the regular collab and the super collab cost meter though. I used regular collabs so little that I can't recall if it cost anything.  I didn't touch the single player so I can't tell you here or there on if it's fun.  The devs seem highly responsive though and are actively looking through streams for feedback which is nice. I might revisit this game down the road when the online gets out of beta but currently I'm not very thrilled with the game mechanically.",0

It looks, plays, and feels like this is just another game where the developer(s) have tried to make a game a LOT bigger than what they actually have the skills to accomplish and make well.  https://youtu.be/M5xoUJPAv9c  The combat, while responsive, feels ""loose"" and clunky and the game, even in the first 15 minutes, reveals tons of buggy content.  Invisible walls galore.  A sword that vanishes and reappears magically.  You press your attack button and see your character draw a sword and all the animations for that, but the sword is missing.. and then it just randomly shows up again with no rhyme or reason.  It's just a big mess, it's not fun to play or interesting in any way.  And this is NOT ""early access"" so there is absolutely zero excuse for a game being in this bad of a state with a $25 price tag.  NOT RECOMMENDED.

I feel like the design is well thought out, the systems are enjoyable to engage in, and I enjoy the modular culture and magic system that meaningfully emphasizes different playstlyes.

Being able to level up in so many areas and having a ton of unlockables  is icing on the cake. The writing is much better than most Paradox games where they try to hide behind humor; somebody actually likes their fantasy here, and it shows (even when talking about molekin and dire penguins).   My first Age of Wonders game, will have to check out the others! (Edited for spelling).",1
137974632,1669000,This game definitely recaptures the magic of Age of Wonders. Its got all the niceties of a modern 4x as well as improving on a lot of the flaws and performance issues of Planetfall. Upon creating my first campaign I was hit with a wave of nostalgia bringing me back to the very first AoW playing as the halflings. Good memories. Definitely pick this up if you like tactical combat and fantasy. The character/civilization editor is always quite in depth and immersive.,1

137974693,1494420,"Again one of those moments where I can't give a game a 50/50 review.  I played for about three hours solely on my own, where I managed to try out the commander system and fps modes, before playing with a friend.  The general consensus of the game is that it is.. Okay. The gameplay can be pretty fun when cooperating with friends, however as mentioned in other reviews the aliens are completely OP. In a 1v1 game aliens will always win, full stop. Human harvesters are too janky to efficiently harvest resources, and IMO would be better off as aerial units considering how they work.  The FPS is cool and all, but ultimately it is useless. The only way to effectively kill bugs in this game is to drive a vehicle, and there are barely many human VS human games in the server list. BTW. ABOUT THE SERVER LIST  Its not very good. Simply put, there is no ""sort-by"" option, so large player servers will require scrolling; really just a simple QOL issue. There is also region-locked server finding, which is silly to have; my friend whom I played with lives in Eastern Europe, and I had to use a VPN to get his servers, and better play with him.  But if you like futuristic human technology with a dash of Dune and a glimmer of Starship Troopers, this is a great game for playing as humans. The tanks, guns and even buildings are beautifully well modeled, some have interiors that may lack in quality but its no real bummer. The humans have by far the most diverse roster of units, some of which I have yet to try out, from siege tanks the size of buildings, to railgun tanks, hover tanks and the like.  Aliens have a smaller roster in comparison, but god damn do each and every one of their units hit hard. The Goliath is actually relatively easy to kill if it is countered by a tank or two, but scorpions (a ranged unit) and their related counterpart are silly to play against. They camp behind dune hills and can straight up kill columns of tanks by simply being able to peek over, and fire at them. Killing one requires hoping its not controlled by a player, otherwise you basically have to ignore them or flank them.  Otherwise, overall the game does not have too much else to offer. There is a prospector mode, and arena mode, but otherwise my only final demands would just be adding aerial vehicles for humans, and obvious tweaking to make the game especially more fun to play. Knowing its a Bohemia Interactive game I do expect these bugs and the like on launch, but then more stuff to come.",1

It surpassed my expectations, especially when compared to the previous two chapters. It's quite evident that the game is intended as a satire, and I believe it has now reached a point where it's nothing but a joke. However, I must admit that I found this to be a positive aspect of the game, and I enjoyed it immensely. It's apparent that the developers have a clear understanding of what they're doing, and I respect them for it. The game's hilarious. If you're able to turn off your brain and treat it like a shitpost, you'll undoubtedly have a great time with it.

Yes maps are a little empty, and AI might not be what people expected it to be, and if you were planning to see state of the art game you will be disappointed, but if you are playing a game just for fun as most people do this game is definitely for you. I have been enjoying every minute of it. It is not Dishonored series type of game, but it has its moments. I know I will continue playing it, and if you listen to every negative review that we get on Steam we don’t have to play games at all.",1
137975587,1294810,Can't recommend this game at the moment.  Its plagued with bugs and disconnects.  The world feels empty when traveling from place to place.  Frame rate Drops are terrible at times... this should not be an issue with the level of graphics the game has.  Have a 3080TI and 3800xt so it should handle this game no problem but poorly ported for sure.   Some of the quests were fun but unless your clearing a nest or doing a mission there isn't much in between.  The nests are super short and you can clear them out in a matter of minutes.  Great Idea for a game but poorly executed.  I might give it another shot if they patch these things out but not happy with my purchase currently.,0

137976737,1669000,"I've enjoyed this game, so I recommend it, but it feels like a step backwards regarding asymetric play  It went from diverse factions with different strengths and weaknesses to.... I don't know. The society you choose is purely aesthetic. Good and evil play *slightly* differently regarding city stability and how that works. But every race has access to the same tech, the same units, from the jump. This means that while you have more customizability in factions, you have less variety in gameplay. The armies also feel less thought out. In Plantefall, tier 1 units had a purpose throughout the entire game. Your tier 5 was like a support unit usually, something that boosted everything but still needed infantry. Everything seemed to have an ability that could change the tide of battle. In AoW 4, that's gone. Your basic fighters are obsolete by turn 20. And so on. Until you end up with stacks of tier 5 units, all on the offensive. The only exception here is the Order tier 5, which gains power based on other Faith units in play.   It's still fun. But there is less replay value here.  I also think it's a step back in terms of.. Wonder. For lack of a better word.  AoW: Shadowfall, the game everyone loves, had significant variety in the world map. In terms of art, you had great forests, deserts, mountains that looked painted. the underworld also quite varied in terms of art. In AoW 4, you have snow, grass, forest, or lava. The underworld is uniformly mud, except for a few tiles with some mushrooms on them. It's less fun to explore. The sense of wonderment is gone. This has been overlooked in a lot of reviews, but I suspect it is a factor in how everyone feels, in why nostalgia for shadowfall remains so strong.",1

Additionally, robbing and pick-pocketing were particularly entertaining, especially when I snatched someone's phone while they were watching me. Overall, pretty enjoyable game for being a start.",1

There is not enough depth of content at the moment for me to recommend the game at it's current price point.  I thought the gameplay was genuinely enjoyable and evocative of old NHL arcade games in the best way. There were numerous occasions throughout my two hours where I caught myself watching my replay with great satisfaction at the various angles and dangles that I found.

[*]Add a retry feature to the Arcade mode, so players can challenge it again with the same character set-up instead of being booted back to the character select screen.     [*]Perhaps add the feature to save a character set-up? Currently it is still ""fine"", but as more characters get added in the future, it'll be kinda annoying to pick your character, palette, and collab over and over.

Tendré que bancarme a los personajes hablando como el Rubius (:  Encima estaba jugando con mi pareja y a él le mostró una cinemática larguísima al comenzar el juego y a mí me tiró al juego así sin más. Toda la intro y explicación se la dieron a él y a mí nada, ni un mísero texto en la pantalla de carga.  En la primera habitación en la que estás, hay un objeto llamado ""Diario del capitán"" y dice que debo clickear E para leerlo. Adivinen si al clickear E funciona bien y puedo leer los pensamientos de ese bendito capitán o no. La respuesta no les sorprenderá. Los personajes que estábamos usando tampoco se comunicaban entre ellos.  Otra cosa que nos pasó es que en cuanto entramos al cuartel de bomberos durante la primera misión, ya estaba en modo ""safe house"" entonces estaban todos los NPC en sus puestos de trabajo. No nos podíamos comunicar con ellos al apretar la E para hablarles, no podíamos comprar nada, tampoco podíamos dispararle al vampiro del sótano. Y, de la nada, ese vampiro desapareció. No había manera de completar la misión principal, así que tuvimos que volver a empezar la partida de cero. Al hacer esto, se arregló todo lo del cuartel de bomberos, me mostró las cinemáticas y nuestros personajes comenzaron a comunicarse, pero igualmente sigue teniendo muchos bugs.  Los vampiros a veces se buggean y quedan flotando sin hacer nada, entonces es fácil matarlos.  Cada vez que entrás a la partida, podés volver a agarrar todo el loot de armas y municiones que ya agarraste antes de cerrar la sesión anterior, entonces es muy fácil llegar a tener veinte pistolas, quince escopetas, cinco snipers...

I recommend if you're looking for a more gorey and punk rock XCOM that you can finish in under 20 hours. Hope there's a sequel!",1

137979511,1669000,"[h1]Age of Wonders 4 Review[/h1] Don't feel like reading the whole thing?  Down at the bottom is the conclusion and score given to the game! :)  [h1]Introduction[/h1] Age of Wonders 4 is the ultimate fantasy creator; it allows you to design and develop your creations and see them evolve into new beings! From barbaric moles to engineer elves and toad lords, the freedom to create races and imbue them with traits is incredibly rich in this 4X strategy game! It traps you in a world of magic and, well, wonder!  The characters you play reinforce the game's roleplaying, thanks to the cultures one can pick. Playing as the good guys is not an aesthetic but a conscious choice to help neutral parties and keep your citizens happy. It changes the approach to each match and how you play the diverse rulers, whether premade or original ones you made.   [h1]Control and Map Design[/h1] The affinities and tomes are the blood that keeps the game fresh, for there are multiples of them, each offering significant bonuses. Chaos benefits from fighting all the time and razing cities, while Materium is about expanding your economy and filling your vaults with gold. The tomes include many spells that serve unique purposes and become extremely powerful as they develop into further tiers.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2973035590  The affinities and races try to communicate that Age of Wonder 4 is a game about choices and adaptability: To start new worlds and see what is abundant, what is lacking, and which are the correct decisions. Rulers have their personalities bundled with strategies to defeat their enemies and control their vassals: The world is full of dungeons, provinces, and resources that can make all the difference between joining the pantheon of Gods or being another forgotten mage in the annals of history.  [h1] Strong Points[/h1] The game's strong point is that it is one of those titles you grab and cannot stop playing; it doesn't become boring or lose its appeal, managing to stay as fresh thirty hours in as it was during the initial three. The secret sauce? It's a colossal library of options when making characters and gameplay styles. The limit is your imagination, for chances are that if you can think of it, you will find a way to make it a reality in the game.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2973035772  The story worlds are challenging and rich in the tale they communicate to the player, featuring some twists. While some players might dislike how unfair some of the story realms can be, others will enjoy the added challenge and some lore to enjoy with the visited worlds. Pulling out strategies is satisfactory, as you can, for example, make a mainland full of ice and undead to keep your foes at bay.   [h1] Art Design and Visuals [/h1] Visually the game is impressive, especially regarding the monster's designs. From giant demons made of black fog to trees the size of a building or gremlins with demonic pitchforks, there is a variety of untold amounts with great personalities that make them come alive on the screen. You can even get bone dragons, archdemons, or golems if that fancies you too.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2973035416  The beautiful game maps feature rich diversity, from cold deserts to islands in the void or lands overrun with lava. There is a lot to admire and glance upon as you play the title, and characters' transformations reinforce that even more as their skin becomes steel or they get Gaia's favor and become one with nature. Animations can be lacking in combat, but with so much variety in troops and content, it can be forgiven more easily.  [h1]Sound, Replayability and Performance[/h1] Regarding the sound, Age of Wonders 4 provides some high notes, but others are lacking. Effects in battle are lackluster, as attacks can sound generic between units. Voice acting in the narrator is a treat, particularly when unlocking new tomes as she speaks about their origins, purposes, and authors. The music is phenomenal, which makes me puzzle about why the developers made it an occasional thing rather than a constant one over the world map.  Regarding replayability, the game has enough content to keep you hooked for 30-60 hours for the average player. Those that dig deep will find themselves with a title that can easily net them 100-300 hours as they explore every layer the game offers. The DLC roadmap also adds exciting content, such as new units and dragon rulers, which is something to look forward to!  Performances-wise, I could run the game only at 40-48 ish framerate on High settings. Like most strategy games, Age of Wonder 4 suffers from the issue of not running as smoothly as it could, but by now, that is a trend of the genre and not something new as we have observed in titles such as the Total War series and the such. Some crashes also placate the game, but for now, they are user-generated, meaning you get lucky like me and barely suffer or constantly get them. The developers are working hard on them and have released multiple hot fixes.   [TABLE] [TR] [TH][H3]Pros[/H3][/TH] [TH][H3]Cons[/H3][/TH] [/TR] [TR] [TD] [list] [*]Incredible amount of freedom in the approach to rulers and mechanics! [*] Monster designs are striking, making you want to acquire and use them! [*]Multiplayer servers where everyone can take simultaneous turns, eliminating the annoyance of strategy games online aspects. [*]Addicting gameplay that keeps you invested in the game trying out every strategy and concept for races you can think of. [/list] [/TD] [TD] [list] [*] Story realms start easy but quickly develop into unfair fights that can become aggravating for new players. [*] Crashes are luck dependent; you barely suffer or constantly get them. [*] The amount of content it gets sacrifices the depth of gameplay that the previous game had, which is more simplistic than its predecessors.  [/list] [/TD] [/tr] [/table]   [h1] Conclusion[/h1] Age of Wonder 4 is a fantastic strategy game full of wonder that can provide you with hours of fun, challenge, and surprises that don't get old as you spin your narrative with it. The prospect of creating so much and then taking it to the battlefield and experimenting with it is rich and full of innovation! It is a beautiful game to explore. While it offers less profundity than its predecessor and suffers from issues, it is a breathtaking game for those who enjoy fantasy and strategy.  9/10  AMAZING  If you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator StarsDeck! https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43679955/",1
137978509,1669000,Amazing Addition to the genre! Can't wait to see where the game goes.,1
137978493,1669000,"Best strategy game of 2023. This is a potent mix of Heroes of Might and Magic, Civilization and a dash of Total War.  You build your own faction with specialized traits, then add more traits in a roguelike-fashion during your campaign. The system lets you build hundreds of unique factions- Demonic Human Farmers, Arcane Golddigger Dwarves, Angelic Orc inquisition, Undead Elven hordes, you name it.  Units also transform visually with each trait/upgrade, letting you build some crazy-looking units!  Campaign length is very reasonable, ranging from 20 to 100 runs depending on map size and scenario. This means you can actually finish a campaign in one sitting and try a new crazy faction straight away!  Don't be put off by the small army size of 6 units - up to 6 nearby armies on the map engage in combat together, so you get proper epic 18 vs 18 unit clashes in the end game.  Looks great, plays great, has amazing replayability and fun factor.  It's incredibly easy to mod every aspect of the game so expect many total conversion mods in the coming months. Expansions are already planned and Paradox updates their games regularly, so great official content to come.",1
137978492,1669000,"I play mostly single-player, and there are a lot of problems with this game, such as bad optimization and fps drops; both of these issues lead to a lot of game crashes. But it seems like the developers keep patching it up immediately after the problems have been seen by the buyer.  The game itself is awesome and kind of want this type of game in my collection (without counting the bugs). It's a great game.  There are many types of fantasy classes, spells, transformation paths, and city developments and improvements, which behave a bit like Crusader Kings, and I like it.",1

Things I would like to see in full game: - all-time character stats and stats for the run of each character in some fashion (most goals, MVP, etc.) - cold/hot streaks implemented in each game or carry over from last event.  - possible control of secondary character for setups on goals - unlocks for different celebrations after goals  and of course I hope we get to play each other online.

You don't get much choice (although I seemed to select the choices that gave me the quickest ending, so my game was over in like 50 minutes) so it was a lot of watching, but that may be your thing.

The game was great when it scared me, many times over it did and it kept me on edge which im 100% glad for however for a 20 dollar game it doesn't seem like its worth it for how short the game is. I enjoyed it but i think i would of enjoyed it more had there been a good ending to the game and if i was able to enjoy it a little longer. Another issue with them game is the bugs that you can have happen, and one of them is getting soft locked at the end boss if you dont have any ammo, so thats something that the developers can work on. There is also no melee wep so if you run out of ammo your sol and jwf Shit out of luck and jolly well... well you know fudged",0

I also like that the meta progression system (buying permanent upgrades that you start with) doesn't give you enough points to spec into everything - you have to pick how to allocate your points in each tree based on what you're trying to lean into. That said, while this is an excellent foundation, the game in its current state is a bit barebones: there are only two characters, both of which pull from the same pool of upgrades, and only one arena/game mode.

137981905,1669000,"TLDR: It really is excellent. If you enjoy 4x games at all, pick it up. If you enjoyed AOW3 or PF, this is a must buy.  I played AOW3 as well as Planetfall. I enjoyed both of them - even spent the time to write up a unit build tree for AOW3 that is still pinned last I checked. This game is better (and doesn't need a build tree thanks to the in game chaining tooltips)  Comparing AOW3 and PF, there were parts that I liked better in each. AOW4 takes most of those best parts, brings them together and mostly improves them. A very short list:   - Diplomacy is much more flushed out  - The province system from PF was improved and is much more rewarding when growing your city  - The system for supporting armies is much better - range of 3 hexes now so don't have to play the fill-the-hexes game in the world map before attacking. It also allows you to use your mounted/high speed units to ride on ahead from site to site without having to wait so long for the walkers  - Extensive customization of your race, leader and the realm. Much as been touted about this but it really is quite good.  - Unit mods from PF were turned into unit enchantments from the magic tomes, which is easier to manage and still lets lower tier units play past the early game  - Chained tool tips for all in game terms and mechanics. You won't believe what a difference that makes in getting the info you want exactly when you want it  - There is a ton more to like but I'll leave it there  Some bits that were lost, which may be important to you:   - Lore. In creating fully customizable races, race specific units (and their flavor text) were dropped in favor of a modular framework. If you were into all the unit descriptions from the previous games, those are gone   - No campaign. I actually enjoy doing campaign missions and although I do miss it, the story realms are kind of a campaign-light. And honestly, I don't mind it as much as I thought I would. The fully customizable sand box experience more than makes up for it   - No race specific traits (they were basically pushed to culture selection). This is a hot topic but fortunately, it is moddable so expect mods to add these back in (like this one: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972670716)   - Looking over the modding docs, I'm pretty sure we can expect mods that add chained stories with custom cultures, units and abilities. I expect someone will go to town with it - something like a Demon Cycle inspired campaign (from Peter Brett's books) would fit right in.  Some bits that I think would make it even better through DLCs and mods:   - More cultures. There are currently 6. It would really add even more customization and allow you to create exactly the different ""races"" that you want. Examples: Merchant, Zealot, Imperial, Nature  - I personally think 2 mind + 2 body traits instead of 1 each would improve customization as well though that could cause balance issues. However, I would imagine that would be offset since all races would get them as well. Not sure if that is moddable.  - Although the combat AI is pretty good, the campaign AI could use another pass. It isn't terrible, but the combat AI is better.",1
137981811,1669000,"I play this game on Nvidia Geforce Now. So, I cannot comment on how this game runs because I do see many people leaving bad reviews saying the game doesn't work or crashes a lot. Playing on Geforce Now I have no crashes at all but then again I am using very high end equipment to run the game. I will say the way things are in this game are different from AOW 3. So, if you really enjoyed that game you might dislike this one.   The units are no longer special to each race, instead they are dependent on the path you take for your civilization. If you go nature you get a lot of units to do with nature and animals. It is actually a lot of fun and diverse so far. I assume more options are going to come in DLC and maybe even some new races. The races do have differences in the bonuses they get based on their race and they are very unique and fun. Even more options than in AOW 3.   The maps are pretty nice so far and I am sure more of those will be coming too. I enjoy the unlocking of cosmetics by playing the game and ascending your leaders. Which is more fun when playing custom leaders. The game is pretty fun in all honesty and I truly do like this game. I would definitely recommend it. However, be warned it is not exactly like the third game. So, not all the same stuff from that game are in this game, which I have seen people leaving bad reviews over.",1

I would be willing to turn it on once I got comfortable and started playing multiplayer, but it is forced in single player too.

137981904,1494420,"Its worth the 20 bucks. If not just to get in before the price jumps.    - It needs work for sure, Ui is all placeholder and performance can get pretty spotty at times even with a beefy PC.  - Game-play for RTS commander is very crude atm and sometimes frustrating but its there. (The AI needs some love and the general unit controls need more QOL features)  - FPS needs some more variety but its there. (gun-play feels surprisingly good)  - Audio and VFX are incredible. They really help get you immersed.  - This has some of my favorite tank combat game-play of any game i've ever played (including BF4, IT FEELS GOOOOOD)  - As someone usually always plays human factions the bugs feel very good to play and have a good identity that separates them from the humans. (they can climb any surface and its not janky at all! very well done mechanic)  - I'm also fairly interested in where they might go with the lore.  - It needs some balance (im looking at you Scorpions) and probably some more unit types for each faction. (flyers for both factions would fit in nicely)  It has a ton of potential. The bones of an amazing game with a totally unique experience are there. I'd say it doesnt have any problems that can't be solved with more dev time and good feedback from the community. The game knows what it wants to be, which more than can be said for a lot of games these days.  All that being said I cant remember the last time I played another early access game for almost 20 hours in 2 days. (wife is not happy)  I have been waiting an FPS RTS game like this for years and Silica definitely can be that game. If thats what you are looking for OR you are just a Star Ship Troopers fan, buy it.  I'd say even if I never played it again, the 20 bucks for a weekend of killing bugs with the homies was worth it.

As more units are added, features are implemented, and the game takes more formal shape, this is going to be an incredible contender in the space. For so long have I wished someone could pull off the RTS/FPS combo and other attempts have been fair but all been lacking. This game, even in its current VERY early stage, is easily set to dethrone all of the prior finished games already.   It's a huge undertaking as you're effectively making two separate games and making them concurrently playable. That's no small task.

137981999,1837580,"This is actually....a really bad game from Wales Interactive. I have purchased and played every title Wales has put out and I can confidently say this one is at about the bottom of the barrel in terms of a coherent story.   The acting performances are all fine/good. The story though makes very little sense. There are people who randomly show up here and there and you have no idea who they are. Characters suddenly have items that you had no idea they had on them. Like, big deal items.   A lot of this story feels on rails. There are things happening where I assumed I'd be making a choice but that never happened. I just watched things happen.",0

It feels real to the people that made it. Most valuable to me, it feels important in the same way the stories our loved ones tell themselves about ourselves feel important.

The lobby system barely works with issues joining lobbies hanging on ""Attempting to connect to an Opponent"" and the rollback netcode with random stutters and slowdowns vs opponents with 100ms ping and about 2-3 frames of rollback.  The game itself is pretty fun but its annoying to not start with burst at the start of a match, which just causes people to play crazy aggressive and the mechanics really lean on a huge amount of offense with almost no defensive mechanics that are in this type of psudo air dasher genere.  I would recommend the game if you're new to fighting games but I hope they fix and update these problems in the future along with reshaping some of the mechanics.",0

137982230,1294810,"I had just exited the beginner's ferry, maybe 5 minutes into the game, when I had to get up to drain the lizard.  As I stood there, a mere 10 feet away in the bathroom, door open, I heard my character taking shots from enemies that DID NOT EXIST when I hit the pause button mere seconds prior to my getting up to pee.  I mean, really guys. If I hit the pause button just to get up to pee and you pop enemies to kill my character, am I supposed to sprint back from taking a piss, streaming urine all over the carpet, just to save my nascent character from death? Did you not think this through?  ""No big deal,"" I thought at first, ""I'll just restart the game with a new character"". Except when I tried, I didn't see an option to start a brand new game from zero with a new save.  I mean, fuck. A goddamn drunken chimp with downs syndrome high on crack could do a better job considering the ramifications of a player pressing the fucking pause button. Or at least, for the love of all that is holy and not, let you start over. Fucking Christ you guys, what the fuck is wrong with you?  And you did worse than that. Bethesda, Microsoft, you were inferior to a goddamn drunken chimp with downs's syndrome while high on crack and you charged me $70 bucks plus tax for the privilege of suffering your stupidity.  Refunded, and it'll be a cold day in hell before I buy another Microsoft exclusive, including Starfield. I'll be doubling-down on PS5. I'm sorry, Valve, that you'll be caught in the crossfire, for their stupidity here, and I'd encourage a serious discussion at the highest levels about the fail involved here as of late, because this is far from the first time such bad things have been unleashed upon gamers at large.

Graphics and character/monster appearances in Age of Wonders 4 is far better. Giant monsters truly look gigantic in game. Character customization is far better in Age of Wonders 4 because the character models look far cooler and you can make very unique looking characters. Yes, I would have to say that Age of Wonders 4 is better than Age of Wonders 3.  I'm giving this game a 9.5/10 rather than a 10/10 because there a few minor improvements that can be made to the interface that would make game navigation easier.  With mod implementation and more game expansions, this game can easily get a 10/10. I would have to say that this game is currently one of my favorite fantasy strategy games.",1

The pantheon ""progression"" system buries the handful of meaningful unlocks, culture traits and starting origins, behind a bunch of way less exciting character customization items; and the costume options frequently clip through each other. Also, there could stand to be one or two more basic units for each culture.  Having said all that, you can play as Mole Joseph Smith, leading the Mole Mormons on a holy crusade to conquer the surface world in the name of Space Mole Jesus.  10/10, though maybe wait for a sale if you aren't a major 4X enthusiast",1

Theres a lot of table steaks RTS controls missing (Shift click for multi order, Patrol orders, stop order, I mean look at starcraft)  Map designs are non condusive for base building (atleast the ones i've tested).   Pathing atleast for the harvesters (SOL) leave a ton to be desired, with where things seem to wanna build terrain can cause a harvester to get stuck on its own platform, if a harvester dies early on you can't replace it. Destroying the building seems to be not an option  Base buildings (like the main base, and any unit buildings) need to be capable of being grouped in to allow proficient and distant queuing of units or buildings  Additionally, the alien race atleast controlled by AI seems weak? maybe theyre not sending enough numbers or i missed the difficulty buttons... but yeah...

137984451,2311190,Nothing much more to say that hasn't been said by many others. The game just kind of sucks. Honestly shocking that it doesn't have any redeeming qualities. It lacks effort and actual care about what was being made. Game itself is boring and short. What's left is a bunch of crap puzzles that are about twenty hours longer than they need to be.,0
137983399,2311190,"While the effort definitely shows, it's being put in all the wrong places. The small details and flair are, in some places, a massive improvement over parts 1 and 2, and the effort to ""flesh out"" the characters is notable. I really like the scale and introduction of Stinger Flynn, for instance. [spoiler]The large stairway leading to a dark room that slowly lights up to reveal him in the center, taking up the entire room.[/spoiler] It's quite effective and shows a lot of promise!  The broad strokes of the game, however, are still fundamentally broken. Unexplained mechanics and puzzles, infuriating and nonsensical world design, improper/poor optimization in AND out of the game, and a story that seems to become more obtuse each second, as if it's being made up on the spot. I'll be following where it leads from here, but I do not recommend playing the game for yourself. If you're really curious, watch others suffer through it instead.",0
137984393,1375900,Great game!  However both my old gaming laptop and my friend's steamdeck are suffering from stuttering. We didn't know that the graphics were so heavy despite being a pixel game.  I hope this gets fixed tho,1
137983132,1375900,Fun game with simple controls and rewarding game play loop. My only problem is that I keep getting swarmed.,1
137982754,1375900,"So far have only played about 6 hours, but the ever encroaching creep mechanic and using your device to carve a path is a new spin on the Bullet Heaven formula, and definitely helps set this game apart from a market crowded with Auto-Shooter Survivor clone games that barely iterate on their predecessors.  overall from what currently in the game it's quite polished, the upgrade mechanic seems to reward bold actions and taking risk, Sure you can kite and carefully pick off all the mobs before advancing but you might run out of fuel, alternatively you can get in close, load up on fuel and go into overdrive.  Can't wait to see some additional characters and modes.",1
137982563,1375900,"Out of all of the Vampire Survivors-esque games I've played, this one is by far one of the best yet.  Not only is there a lot of potential, but the current game experience is quite good as it is.  For me Swarm Grinder is both fun AND actively challenging, which is a rare sight for a game in the VS genre.  For starters, the core game loop is fundamentally different from your usual VS game.  Unlike other VS games where your character gets progressively stronger from killing enemies (of which you have an infinite supply of), in Swarm Grinder your character gets stronger by completing objectives based on the game mode you're playing.  Now, as it stands there is currently only one game mode (it's called Mining Expedition), but it's a solid game mode.  Basically you have to find and clear out 25 locations on a procedurally generated map in order to complete a run.  Only by clearing out locations, and by killing a boss that spawns a couple of times each run, do you get upgrades for your character.  Now, one of the reasons as to why this is so important, is that it allows the developers to balance the game-play and progression in a fundamentally different way than in the usual VS fashion.  When it comes to other VS style games, the USUAL VS style games, the character kills enemies to get stronger, to kill more enemies to get stronger, to kill more enemies to get stronger...  and so on and so forth.  The process exponentiates indefinitely, it is incredibly formulaic, and half the time your work is done for you.  Swarm Grinder isn't like that. You can kill as many enemies as you want, and if that's all you do you're not going to make any progress.  You have a goal, and managing the enemies along the way is designed to be the challenge of the game.  Speaking of which, this is another aspect of the game that makes it more unique and enjoyable for me.  The fact that, for the most part, you can actually manage the enemy forces.  How you do this is through the use of your gadget.  There are currently only two gadgets, and you'll probably want to use the second one as it gives you more control.  The first one, known as Constant Trigger, will give your character a permanent aura.  The second one, called Expanding Trigger, allows you to activate and deactivate that same aura at will. (Do note that when activating Expanding Trigger the aura will grow to the same set size as the Constant Trigger aura, and deactivating it will make the aura disappear immediately.)  Both of these auras break cells, which not only block your movement and need to be cleared at each of the 25 locations, but they can also spawn monsters when broken.  You can tell if cells are empty or filled based on how they look.  As time goes on more and more cells will be filled with monsters, and cells will regenerate from adjacent cells at a gradually increasing rate the further the run progresses.  And while you do have all this control over your fights, you are not the only thing which can break cells.  I'm not going to mention how that happens, as I don't want to spoil everything.  Moving on to how the player functions, I really like how it has been balanced so far.  I won't focus too much on the characters themselves, but rather more so on the upgrade system as that's more fleshed out.  As far as characters go though, currently there are two of them.  They each have their own starting weapons, some base stat adjustments, a couple of passive effects that they can activate by picking up enough fuel to enter their overcharge states, and that's about it for characters.  It works, it works well, and we're just waiting for more as they have more planned.  On to the upgrade system, there's a total of 10 upgrades.  6 of these upgrades are weapons (and you start with one of them based on your character), and 4 of the upgrades are passives.  Whenever you clear a location, you are presented with a selection of 3 of these upgrades.  (Killing a boss will drop 2 random upgrades, and you get to keep both.) When you pick up an upgrade, the first time you do so is always the same.  It either gives you the weapon or the base passive depending upon what you picked.  Afterward, if you re-select an upgrade you will be presented with a selection of 3 sub-upgrades (out of 4 or more) which provide additional modifiers to your weapons and passives.  These sub-upgrades can be leveled up to level 3, and when you have a total of 6 sub-upgrades for a specific upgrade, you will unlock a super-upgrade (evolution) that you will be able to pick instead of a sub-upgrade. You'll want to experiment and look for synergies if you want to make an effective build, and you'll also have to pick carefully as the upgrade system is rather restrictive.  You cannot get everything.  You won't even get close to having everything.  I haven't counted all of the upgrades that exist, but by the end of your run I think you'll be approaching about 20% of all that's available.  Now it isn't just the number of rolls which restrict what you can get.  Out of the 10 main upgrades, you can only carry 5.  For each upgrade, you can only choose up to 3 sub-upgrades.  Also, if you have too many weapons, your character will ""bleed"" to death.  Every weapon constantly consumes fuel, and if you run out of fuel, they will use your health instead.  Both fuel and health pickups drop from enemies, and this resource system adds a welcome complexity to the game play loop by both regulating player builds and ensuring that the player keeps moving.  Learning how to pace yourself with different types of builds is a significant part of the experience.  And as a final note for the upgrade system...  while individual sub-upgrades may not seem all that significant on their own, and a good portion of them provide benefits with noticeable drawbacks, most of them are actually useful and impactful.  By capitalizing on upgrade synergies and learning how to adjust your weapons to function the way that you want them to is all part of having a successful and fun run.  I'll also briefly mention that there is also a meta progression system with permanent upgrades.  There's not a lot of them and you can only have about half of them at any given time, but they're definitely good in that they further supplement your builds.  Overall, I think this game is in a good spot right now, and it has great potential for further development.  It doesn't follow the usual formula and in doing so Last Bite Games has made a gaming experience which is not only fun, but consistently challenging, engaging, considerably well balanced, and I am very keen to see how they'll further expand upon the successful formula they've put forth.",1

137984322,2393670,"Magic Toenail deploys a vibrant art style, strategic gameplay, and a charming story to create my pick for GOT '23. The game forces the player to consider their next three moves in advance, as with each press of WASD they will both move one square in a direction and simultaneously shoot one of three magical elements (Whimsy, Goo, and Sparkle Spells) ... ideally towards their foes. Each spell affects the three enemy types (Goo Monsters, Whimsy Fiends, & Sparkle Beasts) differently, meaning each magical ejaculation will either harm or heal the AI's HP. Consequently, the player must carefully use their three moves to ensure they cast the appropriate spell to do damage towards (and not accidentally heal) the corresponding enemy type, while also positioning themselves in a safe spot on the board prior to the opponent's turn. When the player wins a match, they are presented with two clothing items to choose from that they will don going into the next fight. But choose wisely! These stat-changing garments come with major pros and cons that can drastically alter the endgame. Each level is randomized, leading to an enjoyable gameplay loop that rewards mastery over time. The music and sound design are crisp and tonally match the art style and gameplay beats. The game runs at a dairy-free buttery smooth frame rate on my Macintosh and I experienced no bugs or crashes. I highly recommend the Magic Toenail. 10/10 Worms.",1

137985111,1669000,"This is the best game I've played all year. It has problems, its far from what I'd call perfect, but I have not been able to stop playing Age of Wonders 4 since it came out.   Pros:  The game strikes a perfect balance of deep complex systems and accessible easy to understand mechanics. You don't need to understand every individual aspect of the game to succeed and have fun in it, but there is a lot to explore and experiment with when you really want to. I have learned something new with every scenario I play; new spell synergies, new army tactics, new ways to plan my cities, new ways to dominate the enemy. I've played more than 40 hours already and I feel as though I've barely scratched the surface.  The amount of freedom in customisation is immense. The central gimmick of the game is you handcrafting a unique species and evolving them with crazy magical effects to create something that's wholly yours. There are no standard Reclusive Elves vs Bloodthirsty Orcs, Mountain-dwelling Dwarves vs Greedy Goblins. Nothing is set in stone. You can make those archetypal races if you want, but they're just a small handful of the millions of combinations of factions you can create in this game, all before you even get to the magical transformation aspects. It's not a perfect system, and I'll get into some of the drawbacks of it later, but for the creative driven player it is incredibly fun.  Combat is great, way better than previous entries. It's faster, more strategic, far more interactive than its ever been. There are hundreds of units with millions of combinations of traits and enchantments to change how they feel, but it's never overwhelming or confusing. Every unit has a clearly defined role and playstyle that's reflected in their banner icon so, even if you've never encounted say a Demonic Frostling Tyrant Knight before, you always have some idea of how a unit should be utilised and how best to counter it. In older titles, I would tend to just rush to the high-tier units and stomp through armies with sheer numbers because the combat generally came down to whoever had the beefiest melees and the shootiest rangers. Now, I'm actually engaged with every fight. I'm developing unique strategies for each army, experimenting with unit compositions, and continuously utilising low-tier units in my armies for the entire game. It's fantastic.  Cons:  No game is without its flaws, and AoW4 is by no means an exception. Let's start with the big one: the Technical issues. I have encountered a lot of bugs in this game. Models glitching out, UI freezing up and lagging constantly, and no short order of crashes. Thankfully, the devs are working hard to fix everything they can, and there is a ""hotfix"" beta version of the game you can opt into to receive regular small patches as they go. The game didn't launch in a broken unplayable state like we've grown used to these days, and it's improving every single day, but it's still something you should expect to encounter at some point. Here's a few notable ones I'm currently dealing with still a week after launch.  - The Dark culture's archer unit, the Pursuer, has a broken profile picture after receiving transformations. It displays as a giant triangle on a blue sky and just makes me picture Pyramid Head frolicking through the meadows every time I see it. - When an Iron Golem unit dies in combat, its polygons stretch across the entire screen until it despawns. This one may be fixed already, I don't see Iron Golems in every game, but it was consistent with every unit in the game I saw it in. - This one really annoys me. When you choose a new research that completes instantly because you have a lot of points banked up, the game freezes for about 10 seconds while it tries to update your choice. It happens every single time you instant finish a research, and that's not a rare occurrence in the endgame. Irritating. - Ancient Wonders just don't have events attached to them sometimes, just throws you into a fight unceremoniously. I've only encountered this in the Story Realms but it's really jarring when it happens. It might have something to do with AIs interacting with them before you but I'm not sure.  Back on the topic of faction customisation, while there is a ton of freedom for you as the player to create and explore new possibilities for your races, the game frankly does a terrible job of populating the world with interesting and distinct species. Every Free City race you encounter outside of the Story Realms seems to be a randomly generated species with no connection or cohesion to the rest of the game. The game has a bias towards putting a Free City with YOUR race nearby to your starting location, which is great, but it never seems to do that for the AI opponents. I had a game with two Free Cities populated by red mole people. You could not tell them apart, which is a really hard thing to say without sounding racist, and their cities were right next to each other. The two cities were of different cultures, and therefore different species, with no defining traits to differentiate them from each other, and were both separate from the AI ruler who was ALSO playing a race of red mole people. So there's three red mole races on this map and nothing for you to latch onto about any of them. I wish the Free Cities were ruler's race so there would be some cohesion in the world but alas that is not currently the case and it kills a lot of the fun role-playing aspects of the game.  Speaking of the AI rulers, oh my god they suck. The AI in combat is pretty good (though still exploitable) but on the overworld they are absolutely pathetic. All they do is turtle. They build a giant army of 20 stacks of units and just sit in their cities doing nothing. I have never once felt threatened in a war against the AI. They'll sending raiding parties every now and then, burning your provinces and being a minor nuisance, but they refuse to assault you at any point. In 40+ hours of play, I have never EVER experienced a siege on one of my cities. I have done dozens of siege fights and I have never once seen them from the defenders side. The only time an AI has taken one of my cities is because I left it undefended and forgot to build walls. I've only played on Normal difficulty so far so I don't know if the experience if different on the harder modes, but I've read some players' experiences on Brutal being the same.   The biggest nuisance with that is in the Magic Victory. When you go for a Magic Victory, you cast a world-altering spell that gives you immense power, everyone in the world who isn't already allied with you (assuming allied victory is on) immediately declares war, and you have to defend three points in your cities (or the cities themselves) for 15 turns from waves of spawning marauders and an onslaught of AI armies. Except there is no onslaught of AI armies because THEY NEVER ATTACK YOU! The Magic Victory should be a bloodbath of you defending an endless wave of desperate armies with your incredible power. You gain such a massive advantage from casting the final spell that triggers the victory; every affinity has a unique crazy effect that makes you a powerhouse in combat, on top of halving all of your regular spell costs. But you never get to play with that immense power because no one comes for you. The AI is all too willing to just sit at home and wait for them to lose the game, so all you end up doing for the Magic Victory is pressing end turn 15 times as fast as you can so you can move on to the next game. It's so anticlimactic, they NEED to change this.  Conclusion:  Despite my gripes with the game, both major and minor, I absolutely love Age of Wonders 4 and I want others to love it to. There's a lot more I can write about the game, both positive and negative, but the simple matter is that AoW4 is a truly special game and I believe the developers care enough to make it the best game it can be.",1

I am IN LOVE with the 2D art. The loading screen, the character talk sprites, the cut scenes, the character designs, all of the 2D art had me at first sight. The soundtrack is also just as wonderful! It was very unique, memorable, and was also one of my favorite parts of the game! To add, I was blown away by how good the voice work for the game was. All the voice actors did a wonderful job for such a small game! The main piece of criticisms I have are that the functionality of the game play mechanics could use some work, Dark Oden and Weiss could have been more challenging to fight against, wish we got to see more of Oden's pals at the camp, and gahhh I just wish the game could have been longer!  Overall, I'd give the game a 7/10! While I am taking points off for various bugs and janky moments I encountered, it is very apparent that a lot of passion was put into this and I respect the hell out of that. The story is unique, the characters are charming, and I was interested in the story throughout my entire time of playing. <3",1

137986151,1294810,"First of all: I'm playing on single player and have adjusted the settings to match my setup (low-medium).  I am not experiencing any major glitches or bugs. There are some mild visual bugs like t-posing but (for me) that's it. I've only been playing for a couple of hours but I think I can comment on this aspect at least. What I've seen so far gameplay wise is fun for me, but nothing extraordinary.  I understand that the multiplayer is heavily glitched right now but for people without friends (like me) the game is alright, I'd give it a 6.5/10.  Definitely not worth 70,- EUR though, more like 40,- EUR so maybe wait for a sale or for the devs to lower the price (should not take long in this case).",1

137986450,1669000,"Overall story driven not as much as AOE 1, 2 and SM. AOE 3 story bit on the fence if we got to compare, AOE 3 story is nicer in regards of progression feeling, but if I got to think on the custom ruler I do like this a bit more with the pantheon selection and all. We don't talk of Planetfall (For me that's not an AOE game, it should be consider spin-off I don't like AOE with futuristic theme)  Customisation its got a good amount, I like the minor faction change, and major faction change spells, but what I do feel lacking is the over all species creations. They made it more cosmetic with AOE 4, so it doesn't feel special in that regards.  Plus it feel limited to setting your own lore, like there should've been a planes/living environment, it shouldn't just be two selections and then you got to make a choice of either skill type driven or environment.  Overall it's still a good 4x game, but I would say the price of it shouldn't be so high, rather wait for a sale would say at least 20% off.",1
137986024,1669000,"Having played AoW2 very long time ago I found more recent AoW3 not innovative enough to recommend.  This, instead, is proper new entry. I really like the fundamental focus on custom races and campaign generation. The whole set up starts off with exciting you about all the possible campaign and faction set ups. Each map you generate is made up of many different unique mechanics you mix and match at will, and then each faction you can make has to be made up from many different mechanics you mix and match at will as well. It even has long term progression, further outlining how each game you play is a whole new campaign for your wizard, not just yet another bland random map you generate.  And then on top of that the gameplay of each faction is pretty compelling too. The progression through power levels inside the game still have this unique AoW focus of magic being the main measure of your power, you still keep mixing and matching what your race and faction are even as you play and approach end game. The idea of everything from what your culture is to what units you can have being separated into Tomes of magic is appealing to me for some reason. There's nothing in the game that isn't in one of those books, and choosing which books you collect has an almost a gacha satisfaction to it.  Anyway, bought it on a whim just because I'm an AoW fan, but stayed because this is finally a very strong competitor to other TBS empire builders.",1
137985997,1669000,Solid Game and alot of fun.  I've had it crash on me likes 3 times in the last 5 days but with the autosave feature its not too terribly annoying and being it just released Ive gotten used to this.  I expect they'll have it fixed soon though.  game lacks the depth of the civilization series but the combat is way more interesting than civ.  while not badly balanced I do hope we get some adjustments in the future to keep it from being a solved game.  I'm also very much looking forward to DLC and mods hopefully int he near future,1
137987079,1566200,"When I first played this game I agreed with a lot of the points the negative reviews were making. But after the first patch and learning how to play the game, I don't really agree with a lot of the major complaints. The benchwarmers are pretty easy to have good stats on by the second and third area, and your superstars should be able to carry you through the first 3 elites on normal. Even with abysmal speed rolls on all 3, you can still get them to a manageable point. there's items that will give +20 to a respective stat, and training can add up really quick. Some of the teams mechanics seem really cheap at first, but there's usually certain abilities/items that can help a lot against specific teams, so look for combos that are good against teams you struggle with. The randomness to start your run is just part of the game, you might see a lot of the same superstars or abilities show up. It happens, you can't always get the combo you want, experiment and have fun with it. There are still negatives though. Encounters seem really weak right now, they're often time double edged swords. Training for team stats or playing against the spartans for an item usually seems more worth it (The goalie ability encounter seems especially bad on paper but it might be better in action). Defender AI on your team is mind boggling at times, it feels like they just kinda skate wherever they want at times. The opposing teams will have cherry pickers sitting down the ice waiting for a pass, it kinda seems like they combated it so far by just keeping one of your defenders back with them so hopefully its fully fixed soon. The unlock system is slow, with just under 20 hours played. I'm still missing 2 abilities, 4 superstars, and a lot of Shaggy stats. It might be annoying to learn at first if you're having trouble getting out of the first area, but you'll realize how you have to play the game over time. I really enjoyed my time with it so far and look forward to future content and updates.",1
137986868,1566200,"This game is really a lot of fun. It may be unbalanced but it's still not as broken as anything EA makes. If you can't enjoy this game, then you spend $200 in HUT and still can't win a game.",1

137986897,1494420,"Feels very, very empty. I am no stranger to the concept of Early Access, but I do wholeheartedly believe this game was released too early. I remember seeing the trailers and some gameplay of this game and thought ""wow, what a neat concept."" However, It just feels so empty, if you are alone that is. I spent all of my gameplay just roaming an empty desert. The game doesn't help you at all at telling you where you need to go.   I just can't recommend this for the asking price. If you buy this you are just supporting the devs in hopes they make this game what it could be, which is not a bad thing if you believe in their ambition. Until now, it's just an empty barebones concept.",0

137986396,1494420,"I don't recommend buying this game right now, but I do suggest keeping an eye on it and waiting until some patches are made for this to fix some of the major issues in it before you consider buying it. I do like the concept of this game (it's similar to Natural Selection 2 with a player playing as the commander for their team and every us is playing an FPS, but also with AI units as well as the player controlled soldiers/aliens), however the performance is terrible, at least in multiplayer (I generally only get about 10-15 fps in it after each side builds up their bases and troops for a bit and I'm at the recommended specs for this game), being it practically unplayable at times. In single-player, while there are no performance issues, it's pretty bare-bones, being just one mission split into two-parts that can be done in about 15-20 minutes and offline multiplayer, of which there's only 4 maps and two game modes.  While I wish I could recommend this game, especially seeing as I do like the hybrid RTS/FPS genre, I just can't with these issues at this moment. Being a early access title it should get better in the future so I recommend holding off on buying this until some more patches are made to fix the issues this game has.",0
137986389,1494420,"Awesome concept and start to the game, I hope it gets constant updates because this could be HUGE!

In a vampire apocalypse? In a vampire apocalypse people would be scared shitless.... The people like the playable characters would be among the first to die in an actual apocalypse... -The quests make no sense. Things like, fix the popcorn machine and put flowers on my brothers grave.... Come on... Its an apocalypse!!! It breaks immersion completely. - The open world is empty and feels lifeless. - The gunplay is mediocre at best. - The AI of the enemies is dumb as hell. - The game is way too easy and needs alot of balancing. The stake launcher for example is way to OP. - The game is terribly overpriced. They dare to charge 70€ for for a game thats barely worth 15€... - Big list of ingame bugs that should be fixed  Conclusion: This game is the perfect example of what is wrong with the gaming industry. Especially when it comes to AAA games. Developers and publishers these days are releasing broken and empty games.... Its completely unacceptable and nothing is being done about it.

137989271,1669000,"It's an Age of Wonders game.  4X, fantasy setting, lots of places to explore with your heroes and their troops.  You research spells, explore, expand, exploit, exterminate as advertised.  It has some good points, the game is engaging, the auto combat (which I've been using a lot) seems fair, and the world is colourful.  The manual combat is fine, with a tolerably good enemy AI, and lots of options for turning combat to your favour.  It is definitely a 'one more turn' kind of game.  On the other hand, the UX is bad.  The interface is non-intuitive in lots of places: Your hero can build an outpost to annex a wonder they have cleared, but you can't do it in the province that has the wonder, the outpost button will not show if you try that, you have to build the outpost in an adjacent province, obviously.  Your armies can dig through soft earth underground if you buy the right early-game enhancement, but to do so you need to walk up to the wall, click on the excavate button, and see if the wall is excavatable, you can't actually highlight excavatable areas while being able to move your army.  I've played the game for thirteen hours, according to Steam, and I have yet to work out if it is possible to cycle through your heroes in the hero management screens.  If, say, you have a shiny new object to give your main hero, and want to pass the almost-as-good alternative to another hero, you have to return to the main game screen after giving the shiny to your main before clicking through to the hero management interface to pick the hero to give it to.  I picked up a nifty mythic level unit for one of my armies, but the game started showing up 'resource shortage: souls' at end of turn.  The game has never mentioned souls as a resource until then, has no indicator anywhere that they might be a resource (they're only valid otherwise if you research a particular branch of magic, I think), or hints how to get them, or even if it is possible to do so.  I ended up disbanding the unit, because I had no idea if it would turn on my troops when the turn ended.  Some interface decisions make sense, but overall it feels as though it could have done with a polishing pass.  The tool-tip pop-up information interface is good and works well though.  The game has a big story-driven, multi-stage campaign like-thing going on -- it tries to get you to follow a set of prepared maps, telling a story of dimensional invasion by a bunch of wizards from AoW2 (I think, if I'm reading it right).  I've done the first one, and am not interested in doing any more.  I really don't think that 4X games lend themselves to storytelling or on-rails plots.  The first one felt like a tutorial map, except that the game already has one of those (it was fine).  The story campaign started with a someone trying to be my ally despite severe faction differences, and then they started stealing my territory while telling me how wonderful I am and how I'm doing the right thing to stand up against another bloke who I've barely met and who I'm not even at war with.  It was annoying.  It was also a very small map and the quests given were all very linear drivers towards fighting the other guy.  I feel that 4X games should be more open-world than on-rails.  I think my biggest complaint is the map size.  The maps are tiny, and there doesn't seem to be an option to increase them.  I picked a custom world with four players and the distance between the starting location as 'far'.  I still met the first of the AI opponents before I founded my second city, and the next before I had a third.  If your favourite 'X' is exploration, this is probably not the game for you.",0

137990463,1294810,"About 6 years ago i was in a bad car accident that left me paralysed from the neck down and mute. My only real, effective way of communicating is by blinking (once for yes, twice for no etc). I have always been a huge gamer and my brother has too. When i lost the ability to play for myself i fell into a spiralling depression. All those hours i spent with steam friends, all those amazing memories, never to be repeated. My brother, bless him, picked up on this and offered to play the games I wanted to FOR me while i sat behind him in my wheelchair and watched. With tears in my eyes i agreed and i have been playing vicariously through him ever since. When Redfall was announced we both became super hyped and i couldn't wait to watch him play it. After pre-ordering it and waiting about 3 weeks the wait was almost over. He pre-loaded the game and after 2 more excruciating days of waiting we finally got to play it. He wheeled me into my favourite spot just behind my old computer chair loaded it up and selected our character. After watching him play for 4 agonizing hours i couldn't take it anymore, with the holy will of God himself i screamed internally at my muscles to obey me, I just needed them this one last time, I had to make it stop. With every ounce of strength i had I slowly pushed myself out of that wheelchair and hobbled over to the computer. Not knowing how long this divine power would last i shoved my brother aside and desperately fumbled with the mouse and keyboard to write a refund request. As i watched and waited for my confirmation e-mail with tears in my eyes i knew that while my body had been healed, my mind would never be the same.

137989903,1669000,"I've completed a couple of realms already and have had a blast doing so it's time to posts a review. I picked up AoW3 after watching Total Biscuit's glowing review of the base game and for many years, it was my post played game on Steam. I also loved Planetfall although that's a sci-fi game and not fantasy. I heve never played the earlier games if that's important for you to know.  [b]Faction customisation[/b] Let's get this one out of the way first, shall we? Yes, it is entirely possible to make every single race exactly the same way if you really WANT to make them that way. Each faction (race) has a mind and body trait which you can change if you want to. If you choose the exactly same traits, culture and Tome, you would have exactly the same faction as the last one you played with those choices except for the faction appearance. Now, you CAN do that if you really want to but that's your choice and, to be honest, would be really boring. But it's also possible to make them unique as well. the stock factions that ship with the game are all different but you can make your own and make them any way you like.  There are lots of 'races' to chose from, several cultures and many tomes of magic with which you can customise your faction and yes, they change the way each faction plays. Feudal cultures are different from Industrial cultures. Are they SO different that you feel like you're playing a completely different game? Not really. I guess it is possible to do that as I haven't explored all the possibilities but apparently necromancy is harder to do than other types. I'd say my Industrial Dwarves played very differently from my Feudal Goblins as a result of the choices I made both at the start and as the game progresses. is it Endless Legend  levels of difference? Not really.   [b]Is there a campaign?[/b] Yes, there are campaigns but they're done differently from the previous games. Now we have story realms, each of which is a mini-campaign. I've played the first two and I'm not going to lie, this is my least favourite way to play the game. I don't enjoy being told what to do and prefer to make my own story when I play and there are plenty of realms for you to play this way.. But if the campaigns from earlier AoW titles were your prefered way to play these kinds of games, this isn't going to work out for you.  [b]Realms[/b] You may wonder where the fairy rings and other special sites that allowed the player  to build these special units but they're done differently here like Plantefall's different world types, you have several different realms which have different biomes and special features on them. You can use the presets or customise your own and keep them. And there are many different possibilities here.  [b]Early release bugs[/b] While I have not experienced a single crash or game stopping bug in the my first 30 hours of play, there are plenty of folks who have including one streamer I was watching. There's already been a hotfix patch for some of the crashes but since I never had any to begin with, I can't say how much of the problem has been fixed with it. Obviously, in a few weeks time, all this will likely be history.  Of course, there are lots of small and not-so small bugs present as there often are on launch. The game's balance is also a bit off in places with certain spell tomes being better than others. But I haven't been frustrated or inconvenienced by any bugs but I'm a fairly relaxed gamer so YMMV.  [b]Paradox is the publisher[/b] If you're a gamer for whom these kinds of political issues are more important than the game, well, here's another Paradox Interactive game for you to hate on. Is this going to be a DLC hub? There are four DLC planned for release in the next year but if this game goes the same way as AoW3 and Plantfall before it, that's going to be it. It's not a PDS game (EU, HOI, CK and Stellaris) and we all know those will be supported for years after release. This one will probably be finished quite quickly so if you want to wait until development work on the game is done, you won't have a long wait. It'll get fixes and balance patches for some time afterwards though.  [b]How does this compare with the earlier games in the series?[/b] This IS an Age of Wonders game in spite of some of the silliness you'll see on the Steam discussion boards at the moment. Like any franchise that has legs, the fans of the much older games in the series are outraged that this is not a direct sequel to AoW1, 2 and in particular Shadow Magic. You'll see the usual '[i]dumbed down for casuals[/i]' comments made on the boards if you're interested. If you're a fan of these old titles, I'd strongly recommend watching some videos before you decide because, like Civ has changed dramatically since Civ IV, AoW has changed dramatically since 2. And hell hath no fury like an old gamer 'replaced' by casuals.  [b]Tactical battles[/b] like previous AoW games, the core of the game is the tactical battles and this is where the game excels for me. Plantefall had a strong focus on ranged combat but in AoW4, there is more focus on melee and magic. Some builds are squishier than others or are very vulnerable to certaion damage channels while resistant to others. For example, my tanky dwarves could go toe to toe with pretty much anyone and were resitant to charms but as soon as the electric channel came along, my units went down hard and fast. In my current game, my goblins are definitely less tanky but get a damage bonus from standing together which increases their damage output. Combined with their numbers, they can swarm an enemy very effectively.  [b]The strategic game[/b] The city building is nowhere near as sophisticated as the building in a historical 4X game but it's sufficiently deep to keep it interesting and to play an important part in the game. It's perhaps not as deep as Plantefall's but it's a whole level up from AoW3's expanding borders. There are only a few base imporvements you can build but depending on your culture, you'll unlock specail improvements that synergise with others better than the basic ones.  [bCities and ]Sieges[/b] One of the coimmon complaints we read about AoW3 was that you needed to keep a garrison in each of your cities and that why could a single scout take over a metroplis of millions without a fight? Plantefall fixed this by having garrisons for each city and AoW4 does it differently. Now you must siege down the walls before you can assault the city, units or no units. there are a number of sige projects both players can deploy to influence both the length and the lethality of the assault. is this better? IMO, yes but others will disagree.  You have a city cap which starts out at three but there are affinity bonuses that can increase this total. I didn't usually have more than 6 cities in most AoW3 or Plantefall games and so I hardly notice the cap. You can vassalise cities instead of adding them to your own control so it's possible to have large empires if you want.  So, overall, yes, it's a fantastic 4X TB strategy game and IMO, the BEST AoW title I've played yet. I';ve given it an ujnconditional 'Thumbs Up' but does that mean I recommend you buy it? Hell no. :D Do your research, watch a few videos if you have the time and make your own mind up. We're all different and all this review demosntrates is that I like it, very much. You might have a different experience.",1

(The one thing that could make this into a Pro is if it high lights friendlies and foes much like an infrared sight and maybe add an actual night vision optic)  Rating 9/10 Now as for were i would rate this game is most definitely at the current standing moment a 9/10 it's very unique for its choice in and setting as for story maybe we will get more to it,1

137990722,1494420,"Even though I like Silica a lot I can hardly recommend it in its current state because there's some major issues:  [b]Performance[/b]: Hardware utilization is abysmal. I was stuck with 20-40 fps when playing the game while my computer was literally idling. This is unacceptable and the game shouldn't have been published like this at all.  [b]Pathfinding[/b]: The game has a multitude of units and some of them can treverse rough terran. The Aliens can even climb cliffs and buildings but here comes the issue. The Aliens will always take the shortest path, not the quickest. This mean that your whole army might be stuck climbing a huge cliff even though they could've easily ran around it. Sometimes units get stuck during climbing and it becomes really tedious to get them back on the ground.  [b]Controls[/b]: This whole 'army stuck' issue wouldn't be a problem if the commander view (the strategic / RTS mode) had proper controls already. Like holding shift to queue commands (like in every RTS of the last 15 years or so). Selecting units and left clicking on the map to move the view to that area deselects those units again. This is even more basic than queuing commands by holding shift and should have been implemented before even telling someone that this game even exists.  Maybe this comes over as a bit nit picky but I really wanted to like this game in all of its aspects but right now the absolute basics are missing in the strategic part and you get abysmally low frame rates (especially as human infantry) that the shooter part doesn't make fun at all. Like i said before I really hope that they'll fix the aforementioned issues with the next patches but publishing it as early access in this state looks a whole lot like forcibly pushed to me and that is never a good idea.",0

As a fighting game noob - the game is hard, and I'm pretty terrible. But it's not frustrating as yet because I'm still having fun. I can actually notice some progress, and the game is actually teaching me how to play. I'm excited and nervous about the online matchmaking getting properly implemented.  Overall - go for it if you are a hololive fan, even if you don't play fighting games.",1

The one that makes it unbearable is that the enemy that doesn't have line of sight,  hit my character 9 tiles away BEHIND A HIGH COVER! TWICE!  WHAT IS THE POINT OF COVER IN THIS GAME?  I wanted to return the game but it is over 2 hours. I am a big turn based strategy guy but this game made me think twice before buying/ supporting any tactics game in the future.",0
137992443,1155330,Great game! I have always wanted to play game that would have similar vibe to the Running Man movie.

137992881,1669000,"Compared to Age of Wonders 3, I have to say I’m quite disappointed. I just feel I’d rather play AoW 3. Game feels like an altered version of its predecessor, with extended diplomacy and city development. The game has been simplified and cut in areas, that needed no tampering.  There is no real campaign, so that’s major a downgrade. I’m not saying that AoW 3 had any means a great campaign, but it had its moments. It was adequate at conveying the lore and story to the player. It gradually introduced player to different classes and races, their strengths, and weaknesses. Now you just dropped to the deep end of the pool, and good luck! It’s a frustrating experience. There is no way around it, this new pantheon points and ascension system just sucks. I just can’t make myself care about any of it, and skin unlocks remind me of lootboxes.  Previously defined races are little more than skins, replaced with enormous amounts of fiddling. Races have lost almost all of what made them unique. Some of the old races are missing, replaced with toads, molemen and rats which have no identity. The races feel soulless and there are no racial units.  Terrain matters less. It’s still there, but just watered down. Strategically building cities to a previously difficult terrains, such swamps and forests is now less impactful with the changes. Overall, there is general lack of any meaningful terraforming, again maybe because the terrain is no more as relevant. In this series previous entries terraforming, was integral and interesting part of the game. In AoW 2 and 3 you could literally see map changing to represent your empire and its people. As you conquered more and more. It was brilliant way of physically demonstrating players achievements.  Player can’t flood land, freeze water, or raise mountains. There are some terraforming spells, but they feel pretty niche and are a shadow of their former selves. In AoW 2 and 3 the player could create hazards and chokepoints on the world with spells. You could poison your domain, and clear terrain, destroy roads and bridges etc. Fun, flavourful and engaging. Spells also feel uninspired. There is so many summon spells (can’t even summon dire penguins, so what’s the point) and vast amounts of buffs. Many spells are just slight variations of one another. Players just stack mind boggling amounts of buffs, and I can’t emphasize this enough. Units buff, combat and world spells buff and it’s just dull.  Previously you could summon vines to tear down fortifications, double gravity to drag down fliers, regenerate walls, reanimate cities, explode corpses etc. I am not saying that the AoW 2 and 3 spellsystems were perfect, but least they were much more interesting and felt more impactful. One single spell even in early game, could easily mean defeat or victory. Race transformations are a cool idea, but again mostly boils down to buffs.  I hate the new siege system. Gone are the days of storming the walls with ladders, blasting gates open and reducing walls to rubble. I remember in previous game, desperately throwing civilian units to block gates, so that my archers can shoot one more turn. Grasping victory from the jaws of defeat. Now you just sit and wait 1-6 turns holes to appear and it's just a battle with extra steps. I mean I get it, they wanted a siege mechanic, but this just slows down everything. You can spice things with some siege projects, but man I miss cannons and trebuchets in my armies.  Battles are smaller, instead of max 42 units, there is now 36, so the scale has gone down. I guess, it’s matter of opinion, but I really liked the massive battles. In AoW 3 It really felt like you had grown from tiny fief fighting small skirmishes to a massive empire wielding huge armies. Even more so in Aow 2. Now the player can reach the battle unit cap much faster, so the impact is diminished. The adjacent army hex rule is also gone, and replaced with some sort of system, which honestly, I don’t understand, so armies farther away can participate in battles.  Nevertheless, battles are still quite long slogs, so reducing unit numbers meant very little in that regard. Battles drag on also because you can and should stack buffs (up to nine times!) Stacking bonuses gets tedious fast and slows down the combat even more. Units are also more tanky and combat temporary health regeneration is much more readily available. Heroes and rulers have so much health, it’s absurd. This all contributes to the length of engagements. Water warfare is still very, very dull, even more so than AoW 3. Why is the battleground open water always? Where is the coastline, shallows, cliffs, raging whirlpools, and shifting winds? Where are the water fortresses and cave entrances? This is just extremely lazy design.  I am not a big fan of needing heroes to establish outposts and cities. Maybe it will grow on me, but currently I do not like that pioneers (settlers) and builders are gone. There is a layer of strategy missing from the game without civilian units. No more escorting settlers, building towers to your kingdom’s peripheries and laying roads with vulnerable civilians. The hard choice between expanding your empire and improving your military is gone. Every unit is now a roman soldier, that can now dig and build roads, with empire skill unlocks. You can’t also build narrow underground tunnel chokepoints because the entire province is always leveled when digging. I used to love creating winding tunnels and fortifying choke points. Visit structures are gone, so a there is another layer of strategy missing. No more building superhighways with haste berries, with dem sweet melons en route.  I mean I like some parts. Land battles are still generally fun regardless of being buff central. Art has definitely improved. I like the decisions and little random events. I enjoy that I can spent resources and gamble when exploring ancient wonders. Changes to hitpoints and mind control are welcome. No more mind control and heal cheesing. I do enjoy the extended city planning, building and economy which is something I would like to explore more. Though it still feels streets behind other modern 4X titles. Game runs alright with my older rig and I’ve had zero crashes.   Mostly AoW 4 innovated in areas that it did not need to. It cut and simplified features that I enjoyed immensely in AoW 3. And sometimes replaced them with worse mechanics. I’ll probably keep playing because there are just enough things to enjoy. But currently I can’t see this reaching same amount of joy as Age of Wonders 3 did for me.",0
137992713,1669000,"The game itself is cool, offering a lot of possibilities in battle tactics, development of empire, cities  and heroes. Why vote down, than? Because of terrible translation into Polish, which apparently was done by autotranlator with NO ONE taking care to read the translation and correct mistakes. Every 5th word is misspelled, very often creating 'new', non existing Polish words.  In 50 Euro game that is totally unacceptable, showing disrespect to Polish buyers.

If there friendly they camp there territory period. Hostile and they will relentlessly send waves of enemies at just you and no other AI on the map. 2nd the combat is really really underwhelming. Once you hit auto battle you've already felt the combat becoming mundane and uninteresting. once that happens you'll press auto fight more and more. Thats when the game goes downhill fast and it will be more of lets get this match over with attitude than just an strategic, fascinating  adventure.",0

I barely played the sequels, but this fourth installment feels like such a natural continuation of the series, refined by developers with two decades of experience.  The music is a pleasure to listen to, the game looks beautiful, outmaneuvering enemies in tactical combat feels rewarding, randomly generated maps, factions, events, and myriad Tomes promote replayability, and empire expansion via city growth and vassals is engaging with its synergies.  For sure I recommend.",1

137992814,1494420,Game is pretty basic but not bad.  This is the exactly idea of a game I enjoy. Large and Decentralised gameplay with a mix of RTS and FPS.

ALOT. bear in mind that right above the add to cart function on this store page the follow words Early Access Game.  for those crying about oh well the game shouldnt be released. well i hate to break it to you... EA allows the devs to do more testing faster and start making up for money spent on development. things to look at when buying Early Access Games who the dev and who the publisher are because that comes into play if the game will ever be fully released. is the game janky at times sure, do we want the ability to zoom in on our rifles and vehicles YES, do we want better pathing yes, do we want game and network optimization yes. guess what the game has been out less than a month. so give it time to bake. ive already got my fun to $$ value out of it in one night. at the end of the day providing useful and constructive feedback is what the devs are looking for.",1

137992243,2337630,"There's just way too much wrong with this game as it stands right now. Some of the post-launch patches have helped, but even still the gameplay experience is largely frustrating. Some issues I have with the current version include: - Most of the time it's impossible to win a hitout, clearance, spoil, or marking contest; I assume this is how they've tried to make the game harder, by taking the control out of the players hands. A major complaint at launch was how easy the game is, even on the hardest difficulty. - Tackling, whilst it has been improved since launch, is still inconsistent and unrewarding. Also, it seems as though as soon as I try to get a kick, the opposition player will teleport from 10m away for a chasedown tackle & HTB. Don't even get me started on how badly the game interprets HTB - The AI as a whole is just not in a good spot. I can get a nice passage going, only to have zero players in my forward line, whilst when the opposition gets the ball, they are freely able to handball/kick to players who don't have an opponent within 10 metres of them (who I sometimes can't even control or MOVE). - SOOOO many promised features were missing from launch day, including (but not limited to) leagues outside AFL/AFLW, pro team, and training mode. There's also no grand final ground patterns/guernseys as has been seen in previous trailers. - Although a lot of the player scans are quite good, some are just awful, and additionally some players are just missing from the game altogether (ie Liam Stocker). Also, it seems as though the coach of whichever team you choose just gets replaced with a generic bald guy.  I'm sure a lot of these issues will get rectified in time, but what they've released is not even close to a finished game, and they can do absolutely NOTHING to justify the $100 AUD pricetag. I'm sincerely hoping I will be proved wrong in the coming weeks, but this game is making me consider just re-installing Evolution 2, that's how bad it is right now.",0

137995555,1669000,"I've logged many hours on this series, beginning with Wizard's Throne back in the day. Shadow Magic remains a personal hall of fame strategy title. The series evolved with AoW III and Planetfall, so comparing them to the earlier games is an apples vs oranges deal. They all share a lineage, but the differences are stark. Perhaps that's a good thing: one can return to Shadow Magic, for example, and get a very different experience.  For my money, AoW4 has dramatically upped the stakes over AoW III. Rich designs, praiseworthy graphics  (a flat-out gorgeous game) and sound, and a host of fun systems and choices have won me over. It's a great, layered game out of the box.

137994796,1494420,"Managed to play this game on fps mode and commander mode, first the prospector and then the strategy mode. Then after I tried the beta one to see if it had anything else to offer, the game stopped loading the maps and kept crashing every time I tried to start a map. I know it's just launched but I got to give feedback. (UPDATE, problem seemed to fix itself by watching the whole opening of the game again, or just don't click anything during the process of loading the maps)  As for the gameplay and the game itself, I have a lot to say just from my experience. I haven't tested the multiplayer but I think I'm gonna wait on that, the gameplay has great potential, but the prospector mode lacks difficulty, I can't even get pass the defense part without getting killed on either wave 2 or 3. The strategy mode was kinda fun, I've always wanted to play a game where you can play at either the commander or the infantry, but I as I played, I found it a bit hard to understand how to, the enemies all had their big guns ready and I wasn't able to defend myself very well despite having every building up and ready with no way to get better infantry or vehicle units I managed to figure it out but this game  needs a tutorial to help others understand things better.  As I was playing as commander, I noticed that units tend to get stuck in the dumbest of places. like the harvester units getting stuck in between rocks and unable to move at your command, the movement navigating units are very glitched I tell them to move somewhere, they add in this extra straight line way near an edge of a cliff or hill.  The game can be fun, but since I can no longer play it without it crashing on me all the time, I can't try to figure things out more and pretty much bought yet another broken game with a lot of patching required. Good luck to the developers on this one, and I really mean that, I want to like this game, but I can't fully in its current state.  Also, are you guys gonna maybe add voice work for the units and maybe a battle AI to let ya know a building is ready or a unit is ready?",0

Some people will love the gameplay without liking the traumacore aspects. I don't like DMC5's aesthetics but that doesn't mean it isn't one of the most fun games of all time.  This game is exactly what is being sold in the trailer and description. This is a visual nightmare whose gameplay consists of a high speed mash-up between Sonic, Wario/Pizza Tower, and 2D Character Action Games like Defect Process or ICEY. You will feel extremely uncomfortable playing this due to the intentionally ""unfinished"" art (parry being placeholder art is intentional... right?) but there is a ton of fun to be had in mastering the moveset you're provided. If you watched the trailer and thought ""this looks fun but this is too much edge"" you should pick it up, turn the gore down/off, and you'll probably have a good time.  Pros: - Extremely consistent ""traumacore"" nightmare visuals - High speed, high action gameplay that rewards practice and skill - Great core movement mechanics - No handholding - Good overall sound design - Runs GREAT on Steam Deck, ignore the ""low quality"" recommendation on first start - Tons of options regarding gore and gameplay to tone down the ""traumacore"" experience if you need it - Jan 4, 2021 Tweet   Cons: - Extremely consistent ""traumacore"" nightmare visuals - Some moves alter your momentum too drastically and are way too floaty - Huge learning curve with a really bad tutorial if you're not familiar with this genre (it's worth pushing through this)",1

Simply put this is a 10/10 GOTY for me. They have taken the best of AOW:Planetfall and AOW:3 to combine them into something far superior.

I like the way the moods actually have an impact on play-style and I'm excited to see what details the devs add in as the game goes forward. I also love that the toddlers are fully controllable and can run around the neighbourhood sans parents.

137997759,1494420,"Absolutely Insane gameplay.  There is no artificial ""defense"" like in other RTS games such as COH2 where theres green cover in such. Theres ACTUAL cover and high ground you can use that they will use for cover.   Game gives you Realistic combined armeds warfare.  Does a heavy With a massive shoulder mounted cannon counter an armored car? Sure does. Send him in by himself and it's exactly what you expect. He gets annihilated by the auto cannon. Forcing you to have other units for support.  Wanna use realistic ""Urban Tactics""? Use rifleman as a forward observer and place your marksmen on the highest building on the map w/ the city and the Marksmen will actually give supporting fire for them. Same goes for the Rocket Truck and Tanks. Use your infantry as a forward Screening force for cover/view to prevent enemy infantry to get in close with anti-vehicle weapons and nullify their counters.   Yeah the games a bit ""Micro"" intensive in that aspect. But the game actually feels like ARMA with a Commanding strategic effect. Your tactics actually matter.  Currently the only real downside is the lack of transportation and ""Air units"". Other than that. Spectacular game with lots of potential.",1

Positives: I bought this so fast just because of the setting/theme love Dune/desert etc and it felt like that to me in the theme. The models/animations look good Graphics seem ok Weapon fire, love the sound/feel of the weapons, seem like good gun play.  AI voice pretty cool  The negative right now: Refund for now. Feels too alpha for the money grab stage. Next to no options The stuff in game like selecting your load out did not work at all, Hit E all it does is open up a details about it Back to the lack of keybinds (at least I couldnt find where they were if they existed at all) didnt help to see what you maybe should be hitting on the keyboard to do anything.

137996937,1999470,"Pretty standard horde-shooter. It doesn’t bring anything that would help it stand out among the influx of rogue horde survivors. But, the gameplay is quick and hectic, there are upgrades and different gear, and you won’t feel the burn in your wallet.  No need to learn the controls because they’re standard for this kind of game. All you do is drive around, shoot and use a special ability once it fills up. If you want to spare your mouse, you can select auto-fire in the settings.   Even if the majority of the danger comes from the air, it's a good idea to pay attention to the road as well. There are two types of enemies found on the road. Both can be crushed with you bike, but only one is harmless. This forces you to keep moving and avoid or shoot the other one.  All of the enemies lack weapons, with the exception of one air monster. Everyone else will just hover to your location and hurt you. The enemy diversity is quite limited, but given the cost of the game, this is understandable.  Once you kill enough enemies and level up, you can choose between three random gun upgrades. Some even come with a small negative effect. For instance, one might give you an extra shot but lower the overall damage, or perhaps increase the blast radius but lower precision.   When you eventually die, you're thrown back to the shop where you may use the points you've earned to purchase new weapons or bikes that have different unique features. There are just 3 bikes and 5 guns to pick from, but there is a notable difference between them.  The only two available modes are arcade and endless. The latter is clearly self-explanatory; survive as long as you can. Arcade is exactly the same, except that there’s a boss at the end that you need to defeat before it reaches you.  Unfortunately, the boss is either broken or there’s a hidden gimmick behind it that I fail to see. It’s practically invincible because I barely do any damage to it.    Since this is an early access game, some mechanics aren’t fully implemented yet. One of them is a lab that allows you to unlock something, but I don’t see what exactly. Despite choosing English in the settings, there are also a few parts of untranslated French text; however, this has no impact on the gameplay.",1

138000841,1669000,"I've been playing Age of Wonders 4 on Steam Deck for a bit, and I can say that this is a great game for those who love strategy games with a touch of magic. If you enjoyed games like Civilization 6, then you will definitely love this one.  One of the things that I like the most about this game is the ability to create your own race and watch it grow. This is something that is totally missing from other games in the genre, and it adds a whole new level of depth and personalization to the game.  As for the game's performance on the Steam Deck, it runs pretty well. However, I would love to see it officially verified, as there are some key improvements that could be made for Steam Deck users. For example, the UI needs to be scaled for a screen so small, especially text fields. Additionally, the recommended settings need to be better calibrated, as I often experience performance issues with FPS dropping to low 10s, especially during big battles or when I can see someone else's empire.  Finally, the control mapping could also be improved. I think that Age of Wonders 4 could take a page from Civilization 6, which mixes joystick and mouse behaviors in a more intuitive way that flows better for the gamer.  Overall, Age of Wonders 4 is a great addition to the strategy game genre, especially for those who love magic and personalization in their gameplay. While there are some improvements that could be made for Steam Deck users, the game is still a lot of fun to play and definitely worth checking out.",1

138001666,1651490,"Being a fans of the original The Sims but not so much The Sims 3 and 4 due to its... massive content and added complexity, Tiny Life is the refresh I needed. It's a very simple life simulation game with a pretty easy to digest and intuitive UI that definitely serves its purpose.  The visual is simple and because it's a very blocky pixel art, it definitely adds to its charm. The music is what I always came back for, I love the smooth synth play coupled with some relaxing tune and that light rocking guitar strum. It's just brilliant.  For what its worth this very early access version is definitely fun and enjoyable for me. Lots of potential in the future, and the built-in mod support is definitely something to look forward to the modders (heck, some mod has already happening in the discord). I wholeheartedly recommend this for people who were looking for some lite life sim experience.",1
138002084,1566200,"Absolutely loving this game.  There is a bit of polish needed around the edges, but nothing too bad for an early access indie game.  Stuff like a toggle to turn off replays and things like that, and I haven't experienced any noticeable bugs.  But the gameplay is an absolute blast, definitely the best arcade hockey gameplay I've seen since the Hitz games.  And I never would have expected the rogue-like gameplay loop to work this well with hockey.  I'm excited to see how the game grows and I hope the devs are planning to add more game modes once they deal with some of the QoL stuff.  This game absolutely needs something more like a franchise or career mode with a more traditional multi-season progression.",1
138000191,1566200,"Pretty solid basis for an early access title, I'm already finished for now even though I haven't unlocked everything but grinding is very slow and since i've cleared standard and expert I see no incentive to just grind. (One thing worth noting rubbers gains is exactly the same in standard and expert which feels outrageous to me, wouldn't be surprised to hear that easy mode earns the same as well, a full run is giving you around 100 rubbers after the patch).  Speaking of difficulties, it's the first roguelite i've played where there's a easy difficulty, those kind of games ARE supposed to be challenging and having an easy difficulty beats the purpose of the genre altogether. I don't think adding them was a good idea at all and standards should've been the only mode right now (because yeah expert isn't that much harder than standard) and adds another way to increase difficulty later on kinda like what hades did with the pact of punishment system.  The roguelike aspect needs to be tuned , A LOT of the perks are straight up useless or even worse sometimes completely ruins you chances, it's fine but i feel like better descriptions are in order for some of the perks because it was really not what I was expecting at times. A lot of events aren't worth going for it so most of the time it's just straight up better to go for the training camps or exhibition matches to get perks. I've tested a bunch of active skills as well and again a lot of them needs to be changed in my opinion, because the utility in some of them is just WAY to limited, nothing beats the straight up speed boost good in offense and defense and cooldown is rather fast, and i've tried the most expensive one the dragon shout which feels really bad for it's asking price, they need to be tweaked to be better.  The concept is really good and I honestly wish more companies try to mix sports games with roguelike/lite elements, i'm looking forward to see the updates, what I feel like the game needs is more modes (maybe carreer/season), better customization because I thought we would've been able to create our team/players so more customization is in order, more perks and maybe like most of games in the genre do rarities in the perks you get. There's a lot of possibilities honestly.",1

It's definitely helping me pass the time until Tears of the Kingdom come out. I wouldn't say it's on par with Zelda, but maybe Fenyx Rising is a good reference point.

There is no way around this for me -Half the time I had no damn clue what I was supposed to be doing -So many of the puzzles are unnecessarily long, confusing, or just make me want to close the game. Examples include that one Stinger Flynn bit where you have to shoot the buttons moving at mach 2 speed, the Nabnaleena part, and the Jumbo Josh and Banbaleena bit I can't even finish the game because my laptop might straight up explode if I try. I recommend looking into this because I know I'm not the only one with the lag problem. I'll probably refund this and not get Chapter 4, but just to say, I'm really not trying to crap talk this game.

Seriously this game has blown away my already pretty high expectations with it's mechanics, gameplay, and overall charm.

Not to mention the single player mode: Virtual Frontier is sparkled with lots and lots of references from within the community which makes it it's own fun, cute, and overall feelgood experience for fans. Using the actual talent's voices that was ""clipped"" from their livestream audio is a very good call and with the new updates implementing the actual actual voices that the talents recorded themselves live on stream (Botan & Sora) just adds more to the already existing charm.  If you're a fan of fighting games, definitely try this out (It's free and takes less than 1GB of your storage) If you're a fan of Hololive, try this game out (It's free) If you're a fan of both fighting games and Hololive, boy do I have some good news for you.

138001715,1742020,"I'm not a big V-tuber guy, I've seen clips and know of them but I'm not that dedicated to hollow live. but as someone who plays a decent amount of fighting games i became interested in this project.unfortunately i'm kinda mixed on the game, i think it has potential but its missing polish in the parts it really matters. I doubt the devs will see this but I really hope some of this feedback makes it back to them.I understand its a fan project so I'm not holding to the same standard of official releases, but I do hope the games issues I have got resolved.    So let's start with some positives.   Pros  -[Surprisingly decent single player content.  the difficulty feels kinda inconsistent. Like i picked harder enemies and the run was a total cakewalk until act 3 where enemies start doing 50% randomly. But aside from that it's a fine mode if a little mindless. I feel if there was a unique boss each act that could help break the repetition.]  -[solid training mode.  Having a save state feature is rare but appreciated]  -[Fan game Obviously a love letter with lots of references. While i dont get most of them, the people who do probably enjoy them.]  -[its free and easy to download.  It doesn't sound like a compliment, but when you've played a lot of obscure fighting games/mugens that require extra steps just to set up, a simple steam download is appreciated.]  -[The visuals.  the pixel art looks pretty good at times and the UI looks clean if a little cluttered at times.]  Cons   -[ training mode bug? The  training mode will randomly take 1-5 seconds to reload to neutral, and I don't know why because it feels random. Hopefully that gets fixed.](edit: this had been patched, good job)  .[Game feel.  My biggest problem is the general feel of the game. The main issue is that the game feels very stiff. things like run jumping not caring momentum, and hit boxes feel off, having ground normal cancel chains but not air normal cancel chains,and many of the animations being kinda jank all makes the game feel clunky. The biggest issue I have is that momentum, it just feels bad.]  -[animation inconsistency. Generally the game looks good. Although this isn't evenly distributed, some characters like Botan look very fluid while others like korrone seem to have been made early or got the short hand of the sick. Additionally I feel many of the moves like impact and it can feel like you're throwing around a wet noodle.]   -[Unclear balances.  This section is less about ”X character is busted” and more so that I find the game and characters unsure of what they're trying to achieve.The game generally has very limited combo routes with low damage but has a burst? I understand that newcomers don't like to be combo’ed and you can use the burst to maintain black pressure, but it still feels out of places in this game, with the exception of Botan who is consistently doing 50% combos.while she's clearly a unintended outlier, I ask do you want this game to be a grounded low damage footsie game or a high damage assist fighter, because it's unclear at the moment?   The assists seemed to be designed for neutral control  rather than combo extension. but considering the meter requirement some seem clearly better and more flexible at that than others. Also the colab supers are not explained well and are unclear how they work. They could have better descriptions  Character playstyles feel a bit undefined. Like botan is supposed to be a large high damage zone with the grenade damages being as is. But she has, good run speed,fast disjointed buttons, one of the best jumpins in j2c,and looping close range block pressure(witch currently only loses to Invincible moves with how plus it is) which makes her a better rushdown character than Ayane, the actual rushdown  character  Additionally Soras is supposed to be a setplay character which implys shes supposed to get a loping mix of her knockdowns, which is implied by her having a 6c overhead, and an oki fireball. However her 5m,6m, and jm combined with her 2 other fireballs, and projectile reflect makes a way more effective zoner than arguably botan, because Botans full screen guard pressure mostly loses to jump in air block, (aside from the chip you take).  While I could go on, what I'm trying to get at is the playstyles could be more defined in achieving a specific goal, so it's easier to understand what each character trying to achieve.]  -[other character bugs?  Hears some of the stuff i found Kokos otg grab turns the character around for a few frames, the grabs minus but if the ponte tries to punish too early they get a button that's facing the round way. I don't know if that's intentional but it feels jank. Soras Oki fireball last between rounds , and can hit round start  Not recommending this game is odd because it's literally free so you're only wasting time if you don't like it.But this game has problems that i would like to be fixed. but I hope for the best for this game and get the polish it needs. It's doing well right now so for the devs sake I hope they can deliver on a great fighting game. The potential is hear it just need more time in the oven",0

138004918,1669000,"[b]Charging £40 for this game, at this time, is theft.[/b]  To new players, this game feels like Civilisation, Total War and XCOM had a baby. Continental maps combined with tactical battle maps make for a wonderful mix of gameplay, and the game is visually appealing, familiar in playstyles to other games, and a good time sink. The fantasy elements are fantastic, and being able to tailor a race away from the norm is very satisfying. The tech trees, in the form of tomes of magic, are a brilliant alternative to a standalone system — not being able to unlock everything in one game makes this very replayable.  What makes it unplayable, however...  Multiplayer doesn't work for a number of reasons, fundamentally because you can't connect to your friends at all (in a genre usually designed for multiplayer). I can't comment on multiplayer because I literally cannot play it. Quality of life basics are non-existant: cameras constantly track movement in tactical maps (and you can't turn it off), so with many units moving on a turn, your map is spinning and causing motion sickness; the UI is clunky and all over the place; and the map mechanic for a cartography-style world map means you can barely zoom out before the map is visually simplified. The tutorial is poorly designed for a game this vast, and favours teaching tactical options over basic gameplay mechanics. Diversity/inclusion is minimal, if not vacant: only he/him and she/her pronouns are accepted in the game (what if I want genderless mystical elves?) despite it being 2023 and only one afro-type hairstyle to start with is disappointing. The game difficulty seems to curve drastically mid-game (which is only 30-50 turns) leading unexperienced players beaten down and confused. If you had a theme in mind for your order-driven high society humans, you'll likely receive a mount, weapon or unit that makes absolutely no sense for your immersion. Maps sizes cannot be adjusted further than the distance between leaders, so large maps with few leaders are impossible, which is a shame. Maps feel incredibly cramped despite customising distances to ""far.""  Don't buy it yet. Wait for Paradox to provide the full game through pricey DLC, as they are wont to do, and get it on sale.",0

They are not amazing or super duper, but decent to the game! It's alright..  Audio: Some cool audio, specially the characters voice over. The crash dummy is amusing but constantly repeating the same sounds is annoying. The engines do kind of all sound the same though, but it depends what you are doing.  Controls: So I use a controller because I find it easier to use then keyboard and mouse.  Game-play and everything else after: So there are some issue's with this game which I will explain below!  You choose a character, a vehicle and go into a randomly chosen game as solo's (As I write this review, there is no chance to team up with friends or do squad/duo games)  Once in a match, it's a process of elimination as you go through 4 modes (If you make it that far that is) and each mode is different.  The vehicle control is HORRIBLE! The only way to explain is input lag with like trying to ride an ice cube down a hill, it's that slippery and something you really need to get used too. Using a controller, I press turn and I can see it's delayed a little like a desync/input lag and needs a fix.  On the topic of input lag, because there is no local servers, the game throws you into whatever lobby it finds and this will hugely impact your game with lag. It has happened so many times, I've been driving and then instantly dead... like how, so try again and nothing around and boom a vehicle just appears, it's that laggy but I am putting this down to a major desync issue with the servers. So a huge annoyance!  There is a handful of modes to choose from, they are not all bad but some are more fun those others. The flying is not the best and sometimes it doesn't help and you have to force restart to re-spawn. Some modes like get the max distance, NOT A CLUE how others do it, same as how you swap to the jet pack instead... Doesn't work all the time so I waste my nudges.  I think the game has a lot of potential, it has only just been released as I write this review and I played the alpha/beta (Which I did not get any goodies for) but it was alright then, it's alright now. If this game had a cost then I would expect below £10 and no more because at it's current state, it needs major improving.  There is a handful of vehicles and skins to choose from, if you win currently then you do not get anything for it. There is no rewards, levels, unlocks etc. It's just play and have fun which is okay...  Would I recommend this game?

This game locks down character progression with a limited view and monsters are constantly generated as the character moves around. This creates a sense of hard difficulty despite the game lacking difficulty modes.  This game could only get better with the introduction of new characters that specialize in the other weapons types. As of right now, they are only character that specialize in gatling and blade. I would love to see this game get characters that specialize in mortars and missles.

Sure it's a X-COM like game but it really has its own identity : the gameplay is way more action-oriented (no 100% waiting behind your overwatch) and an aggressive play is widely rewarded and feels soooo fluid.  The game is basically composed of two parts :   During [b]the exploration[/b], you walk through a maze of post-apo sceneries, dodging traps, surviving small ambushes, resolving puzzles and competing in arena (some are not required)   During [b]an arena[/b], all the enemies are seen on the map and you have to find a way to dispatch them. When some conditions are met, other enemies might pop on the map at different gates.

The only issue that annoys me is how sometimes in combat when youre playing multiplayer it'll desync and then when you reload it starts replaying everything from turn 1 so you need to fast forward through all of it which takes 1-2 minutes. That only happens in manual battles, so i haven't had many issues with it, but its happened once or twice during combat. The game is not nearly as broken as some others that come out today. If it fails to start the simple fix is to open the game properties > go to betas > change it to the hotfix beta. Otherwise, its a very fun game. A good 4X type strategy, and very cool customization with the ability that you can customize your own empire much more in depth than in most games.

138006168,1494420,"I’m only 3 hours into Silica but I wanted to leave my thoughts because we are still close to launch and this game is getting buzz online so many people might be considering a purchase. I have sampled a little of everything silica has to offer, including single player RTS skirmishes of the alien and human factions, an online game where I played FPS mode, and the brief FPS tutorial mode.   I would recommend Silica with the caveat that the game is not finished yet, so don’t expect as much. So far the game delivers an excellent start for an FPS/RTS hybrid that has a lot to offer fans of either genre.   The game plans on having 3 factions, but right now there are two. The Humans will be later split into two different factions, but right now they are identical. Currently, you can skirmish against AI and play multiplayer and switch between FPS and RTs modes.  My thoughts on the RTS aspect of the game:   Like most other RTS games, the meat of the gameplay is balancing collecting resources, teching up, producing units, exploring the map, expanding your base, and fighting the enemy.  The humans need to protect hulking harvesters (think dune spice collectors) and specialize in ranged combat. They are better for turtling and can field a satisfying range of infantry and land vehicle units. Their buildings take long to constrict but are tough and can be protected effectively because base expansion is not easy.   The Aliens are what you’d expect from the other side of an asymmetrical RTS game. They field cheap units that specialize in getting in close and overwhelming the enemy.  They can easily expand their base with quick to build “nodes” and collect resources using small, cheap, and easy to produce harvester units (GLA workers vs USA supply helicopter in C&C generals). They focus on map control and production. If you can expand your base, pump out units, and collect more and more resources, the goal is to steamroll your opponents. I found it harder to play the aliens, as balancing expansion and production is more difficult to manage, and the vast desert expanses of the “wasteland” map I played on favored to ranged units of the human AI. But overall, the Aliens are a neat faction and I think with some tweaking they can be more approachable.   Some ways that the RTS aspect could improve: There is currently no way to micro. You can’t really focus fire on certain units. There is no building que. When playing aliens, it would be great to be able to que nodes, so they auto build out to the place you want to expand your base to. It is tedious to keep building them one by one. More hotkeys would be great as well. Air crafts and flying aliens would be great, as well as transport units so our infantry can mount up and cross the vast expanses with ease.   Also more ability to mesh with the FPS players would be great. For example, the RTS player could being a cannon battery that the FPS players could use to call in fire support. Or the RTS player could build supply or spawn points the FPS players could use.   I also wish there was scalable AI difficulties so we can experiment with different strategies.   My thoughts on the FPS aspect of the game:  For an Indie game, the FPS gameplay is solid. Gunplay feels good and being able to play in the sandbox is always fun. While I played, it brought me back to playing the original battlefield games, the scale is so big. It can be difficult to figure out what is going on, and the AI commanders aren’t always competent enough to give you good directions.   There was some great moments in the online FPS game I played, including a mass combined arms charge of tanks, vehicles and infantry against the enemy base.   The various classes that I played felt good and the vehicles perform well. I got into a tank and it was really fun!  Some complain about the maps being too big but the teleporter really helps. I think being able to build teleporters in the FPS mode would be fun.  I wish the starting classes had grenades, sidearms and deployables, I feel like that would really make me feel as if I had a load out.   Overall:  This game has potential and is worth supporting. The RTS game is good, and the flexibility of an RTS/FPS hybrid means gameplay won’t be stale. I look forward to this game’s continued development, and I hope to be playing this game for a long time to come.",1

138007326,2311190,This game is actual garbage. I know these games are popular due to streamers playing it but I will not be playing these games anymore. The attention to detail on level design is non existent. the developers seem to have just put out the minimum so they could just make money off it. the game mechanics are also complete garbage. close to the end of the game if you die you have to spend almost five minutes to get items you already got because there was no thought in the checkpoints. This game series is a Trojan horse so they can get your money. this is a shell of a game. I will say this game has potential if the developers cared more about the game than the money.,0

138006898,1742020,"This game markets itself as being for hololive fans, but I'm here to tell you that's not important. What this is is a surprisingly solid fighting game and all for FREE! The mechanics make it very approachable for newcomers, and the tutorial does an exceptional job of introducing you to the simple yet deep battle systems. The game plays as if you're in somebody's Twitch stream while playing, but it's endearing without being obnoxious. The sprite animations are incredible, and the matches are snappy without being too quick. The online is also incredible, even though the game says it's in its beta version. 2 of my 3 hours were spent in online matches, and I didn't experience any lag against any of my opponents.  My only critique is the training mode. The options of how to program the AI are somewhat limited, and there's no way to display frame data. This is such a minor point because even Tekken 7 got this wrong for MANY years, but I still hope they expand it later.  I highly recommend this charming, brilliantly-crafted game. There are some genuinely funny and clever things thrown into the game that show this is clearly a project of love made by passionate people who know what they're doing. Now I'm going to post some of my notes about the system below for those that care.  This is a 4-button game. For those that are unfamiliar with what that means, your attacks are Light, Medium, Heavy, and Special. Certain special moves can be performed by either pressing the special button and a direction or by performing the ""fighting game"" motions on the d-pad: quarter circle forward or back. The reason you'll want to perform with the motions is two-fold. Firstly, you have more control over the ""version"" of the move with motions. Special+direction only gives you a single version of the move, whereas doing the motion and pressing L, M, or H changes the properties: light is quick with little damage, medium is a slow heavy-hitter, and heavy is the EX version. The second reason is that performing the motion fills an in-game resource that lets you call in the assist character you selected at the start of the match.  You have a super meter and a friendship (I think?) meter, and the game bases a lot of its system on managing the 2 different gauges. Super meter is for all the usual things, like supers and EX moves, but it can also be used to call in your assist or supercharge your friendship meter. Burning a full friendship bar brings in your assist for some persistent effect that varies based on the character, but they're all strong.  The game also has some of the fighting game staples, like universal overheads and throws. I think the game's depth definitely comes from character combinations and meter managements. However, the game doesn't feel cluttered or bloated. The UI is good, and I really like the pace of the matches. If you read all of this, I hope my review helped and I appreciate your attention.  See you in the lobbies!",1

138007820,2322660,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a battle teams / blood strike account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

138012550,1940340,"Fun game. Don't listen to the haters, different style of game does not equal bad.",1
138012548,1940340,"They removed everything I liked in Darkest Dungeon.   I'll go step by step with everything I don't like, and things I like, I'll start with the good things.  NEW ARTSTYLE: The new art style in 3D kind of high end 2D mixed in it and style is so cool, clean, and good looking, it's rich, it's beautiful, the artistic direction did such a massive good job on that. It's very well donne and the characters looks now more like the tough dark fantasy characters they are supposed to be.  COMBAT:  The dynamic of the combats is better with that new angle of a 3D, and the pace is good, although, it became a bit more dull because we can't use that much objects during combat as we did back then, it was more freely of use in DD1, now here it's more... complicated, you have to equip the combat items beforehand and all, and it's less easy to be well prepared. Still, I like the combat system, it's not too far from DD1, still turn by turn, still with those epic zoom in on hit and all... Only real downside is the stress system, I feel like only 10 points of stress is very few and can be easily filled, if RNG isn't on your side. And RNG is clearly never on your side, especially in darkest dungeon. So I feel like it's the weakness of that new format. Maybe something to work on later, idk, they don't seem they will listen to their fanbase sadly.  RELATIONSHIPS:  They added a feature of relationship between the members of the group, I like this, it's giving us depth to work on around our group of adventurers, it's not too easy and not too hard to kind of ""chose"" how it will goes between character, although there is again an RNG factor, this time we can have measures to counter the RNG surrounding this new feature.  And that's it, I stretched as possible as I could, everything that I liked. Now for the things I disliked to the point where, I'm refunding this game, and wil lwait for a 90/95% sale for it.  STAGECOACH:  I don't like this feeling it gives, to take care of this stagecoach. It's not like the Hamlet, we didn't needed the same thing but not that different either. So yes as you saw kind of everywhere, they replaced the Hamlet with that stinky cranky stagecoach. So you have to ""drive"" the stagecoach, manually, hopefully you just starts by pushing one button (and you can brake and stop with an other one), but, you have to ACTUALLY DRIVE. It's so clungy and extremely poorly designed to drive. I hate it so much. You don't really upgrade it like the hamlet, you more like.... give it armor and repair the wheels sometimes...heh... It doesn't feel rewarding at all, the grind becomes meaningless very quickly. And so it really never starts to look like something better than before, it's dull.  CHARACTERS:  The crusader Reynault is nowhere to be found, and Dismas is without him and I can't imagine one without the other, I managed to keep them alive both always together in missions for the success on DD1, just to see there was really nothing behind it. I'll say it, I was expecting some kind of romance between them but that's more a personal view than a real expectation for the franchise lol. But yeah, no crusader, and the roaster is smaller, which can be explained by the new choice of artstyle totally. Also, no more hound master and it's a huge let down too, no arbaletist and no antiquarian, I know what happen with these two and I won't spoil someone that is eager to play this game and that is reading. But still I wish they would be with us. There is a new class char added, the runaway and sincerely, it's a poor and terrible Sasuke from wish. And I have an other but, that will go in the group formation section.  GROUP FORMATION:  You can't no more do you own formation or groups of char. You start with Highwayman, Tomb raider, Man at arms, and the plague doctor. And then you recruit some others on the way... But you can't no more make your own strategy , formations etc etc, it's all dead and gone.  I'll buy it again FULL PRICE if they change their minds and give us again this possibility of recruitment, that was SO FUN during the past. Talking about full price, next topic is about their mentality.  NARRATOR:  They gave weird new direction to the narrator, he sounds, a tad weirder and less like a human voice, it's really a thin change though, most people won't really tell a difference. They also modified his voice even more to a point where it's sometimes, feels a bit out of context, like he accentuates or diminish the volume of his voice, and it's kind of just awkward at certain moments.  IMMERSION:  The immersion is halved by half from DD1, the whole ambiance is kind of swiped by the stagecoach feeling and so, you go by areas without really realising what they are, or where you are really and it's foggish, it's unclear and you can't really appreciate the locations since well, you're going fast on these wooden wheels of course. But it's worse that we have to actualy drive so we don't really see much or feel much, we are concentrating on being like ""ok more to the right, right ,right oof.. ok left , more left now !! ok... right.. ok ... forward.. left left !!!"" it's annoying tbh. Seems fun for the first road and very haha le panic haha le driving quirky but it becomes super annoying in real quick. So yea we lost the ambiance and it crashes the game concept a lot lot.  UI ISSUES:  The UI has not been tested at all, I can't believe there was playtester or EGS buyers that made good points about it. The UI is a mess, we don't know where to click to go forward lots of the time, when we have to click to move forward during end of cutscenes or explanation floating text that don't disappear easy, lots of stuff like that , that adds on the overall issue. It's a mess during some stops on the road too, you don't know where to click to go back on the road, the icon is extremely discreet, non explained etc. The tutorial is agressively present on the screen even though you already read it and closed it.  MANAGING FEATURES:  What I mean by that, is the management of the stagecoach team overall. There is mention of the use of food but it's not well explicitely explained in the tutorial... so again something you have to pick up on the road. And also you don't upgrade your hcaracters stuff anymore, and that's a huge let down, you do upgrade their skills at least, BUT, it's through a weird point system that you only get to do when you finally found a road-inn and it's badly explained, again the UI is a disaster made by someone that clearly never worked in UI before and was just here to do the job quickly at the moment, I guess with 5 more millions dollars they might would have took the opportunity to hire good UI/UX designer. Anyway, due to that, you don't understand that the points you have to upgrade your skills, are GENERALLY SHARED, so when you consume one or two on a char, you on an other char, and , oh surprise, you lost points to spent on the other of course, so an other thing that would need a rework. But hey, ""new"" managing feature is a repairman  for the stagecoach, that is... just repair wheel, or repair stagecoach armor, and add items you have to improve it , but it doesn't really do anything else and is extremely boring very fast and forgettable feature.  MARKETING OF RED HOOK:  They took EGS money and put it in exclusivity for years, even though, it's the Steam community that made helped their game a lot for a long time (modders community), and they worked for free, making their game an even greater success. And the thank they get, is an epic exclusivity, for the money because greedy dev's , that can't even used these 5 millions of $ generated before epic contract, to make a game that lives up to their community's expectations, that they always pretended to love and to be so grateful to have built since the kickstarter project ? I don't trust them no more, that's an other studio join the steaming pile of greedy corporates that manipulated passions of millions.  TLDR; Get it on sale",0

A couple of weeks ago I was able to join a pre-release test group allowing me to test and provide whatever feedback I wanted. The developers were extremely receptive and helpful.

I fear that most of the negative comments will boil down to dd1 fans wanting something different ,but that's why I wanna put this first as I know dd1 Is a good game and dd2 is not the same as dd1, Not too say that dd2 is bad quite the opposite.  Dd2 Is amazing, Its visuals, Its system, Its combat, Its progression, Even when it was in beta (mostly why I'm allowing this like low hour review I have like 600 beta hours on epic) It was good and The devs made it better and better,I feel if you haven't played a Darkest dungeon game that you start with 2 first. My recommendations too 1 usually boil to them playing for 10 hours losing a team and never playing again. With the dd2 system you can always be progressing. Even if you lose a team there's always a better chance to improve, understand enemy attack, understand bosses, unlock items, improve your ride, Get cosmetics, unlock hero stories by playing them out.   ONE BIG ISSUE SAME AS DD1. This game is hard so if your a casual gamer who is not that good at turn based games, And you just want a story experience, They added a flame that will just slowly make you stronger and stronger called the Radiant flame, so the game will be a bit easier the more you fail.  Really If you like dd1 this game improves and the system and characters in a major way And I would say full heartedly That Rh as a studio Is amazing And they plan to make more updates, If you have a issue however there's a discord that they listen to all the feedback in you should check out, Maybe even learn from some pros.

I've been searching for a modern Heroes of Might and Magic type game for years and have essentially tried them all, including the predecessors to Age of Wonders 4. Many of those games were and still are good, but fail to capture the beauty, depth, and imagination the developers instilled into Age of Wonders 4. So far the game has exceeded any hopes or expectations I had for it. It has charm and beauty, options to customize everything from your hero, your faction, to your world where you can battle beasts, dragons, magical creations, and visit ancient wonders. You choose to do it your way with friends or foes and the hook is that each time you start a new game, it's just as engaging.  The game executes so many things so well - the breathtaking, stunning visuals, sense of adventure, polished UI, atmospheric sounds, serene narrator, customization options, stacking tooltips, and so much more. The combat itself is intuitive and doesn't feel like a slog and you can totally skip it with out feeling guilty by using it's great autoresolve. Some of the replayability features like unlocking cosmetics or running into a hero you created in another campaign feel like icing on the cake but I really hope they are expanded upon like giving you the option to have a fully decked out hero you made start a new campaign or randomly join you!    Age of Wonders 4 is now my go to strategy/4x game and I have them all. Hats off the Triumph Studios and thank you. I'm a little sad I won't be dusting off Heroes of Might and Magic as much but can't wait to see what they add to the game in the upcoming expansions.",1
138010443,1669000,"The fewest Words to describe the game with be Very wide little depth.   The gameplay is engaging, but sadly not one that triggers the one turn more like many similar games can.  Why am i recommending it than? Well, it has potential. The game as is has a lot of issues, many I hope they work out as time goes by. The Ai tends to be very timid in attacking when it is uncertain of victory in a specific fight. It will often shy away from 3 stacks if it can not beat those stats with its own, even if it has 6 or more stacks nearby to  do a followup attack with.   The customization is quite a lot, though in the end as a game progresses that initial customization matters less and less.      Pros  Lots of customization.  Lots of unit types  Lots of research Cons  Horrid story missions  Little depth to the game play.  AI is just horridly bad.   Occasional crashes in my 80ish hours i had 5.",1

Request: Please give resource collectors points on the board so the are more motivated to care for Logi. @bohemiainteractive   The Long: AI is very bad at driving harvesters, single player mode needs check points and is not fleshed out (alpha) but could be great, online play has some bugs and some bugs that brake joining (bug jokes). Need a surrender option for lost games instead of quit rejoin.   Ending on a High Note: Lots of units to choose from many of them give you satisfying feed back from first person and command view visually and auditorily with great lvl detailing bugs crawling all over on rock rock formations and huge explosions from rockets long, medium, and close range engagements all feel really good.

138012090,1656050,"If you're like me and love a good roguelite or strategy game, then you need to check out Remnants of the Rift. This game has everything you could want in a game - awesome combat, cool visuals, and a unique story.  In Remnants of the Rift, you play as Morgan, a mercenary who dives into the Bast, a new reality that's been merged with our own. The game's combat system is really cool - it's a mix of real-time action and time-freezing strategy. This means that you can pause the action at any time and plan out your moves before jumping back into the fray. It's a great mix of fast-paced combat and strategic planning.  And let me tell you, the visuals in this game are stunning. The retro-futuristic art style is so cool, and it's set to an amazing soundtrack that really immerses you in the game's world.  But what really sets Remnants of the Rift apart is its story. The game's story is engaging and really keeps you hooked until the end.  Overall, if you're a fan of roguelites and strategy games, then you need to give Remnants of the Rift a try. It's a seriously cool game with awesome combat, great visuals, and a unique story.

In desperation, I struck a bargain with the ancient things that surfaced in search of sacrifice when the moon was right. Their price was to unleash doom upon the world. And so I did. Oopsie. My obsession caused this great foulness, and it is shameful that I must rely upon you to set it right once again. In the Darkest Dungeon 2: Mountain Edition.",1

DD2's art style is magnificent, the 3D was pulled off very well, and although there are still some flaws and questionable design choices ( Like enemies with Death's Door that i still don't know how to feel about or the use of Candles and ONLY candles ) I do recommend this game as its own thing. Its a proper sequel who varies a lot from the first one while still keeping the Darkest Dungeon spirit alive.",1
138014500,1940340,"Good game, give me more character to DD1 from next update",1
138014350,1940340,"I just finished my first run and WOW. Such an amazing experience. Everything about Darkest Dungeon 2 is absolutely superb, the animations used when selecting a skill, the effects, the music, the unsettling design of the monsters, the overall look of the characters are so well done. The game has very good replayability since the Altar of Hope (the meta progression system) has HOUNDREDS of unlocks. There are 12 characters in the game at the moment, each of them has 11 skills, and on top of that, each of them with 3 subclasses affecting these skills in various ways, so unlocking things run after run doesn't feel boring or tedious, compared to Darkest Dungeon 1 where the randomly generated dungeons weren't really diverse and the mid-campaign was just grinding random dungeons and slapping the same trinkets on the same heroes with the same skills. Darkest Dungeon 2 aimed to make every run unique this time and succeeded introducing so many playstyles and variables.  The game is mostly focused on combat, which is challenging and involves a lot of strategy and critical thinking. Heroes and monsters can be healed, bled, poisoned, burned, dazed, stunned, blinded, weakened, comboed (a special effect that empowers a skill after another hero applies it) etc, there are so many ways to play with these effects that you notice every run each team develops a unique strategy to deal with the enemies. These effects come in the shape of tokens, little icons under each character. This is a MASSIVE improvement from Darkest Dungeon's 1 combat system which consisted only of random weird percentages, like 37% chance to hit which made it frustrating and unfun sometimes.  Even though the game is very action packed, there are things that have to be managed. The heroes you go on the journey with have their quirks, opinions and feeling towards their companions. Should 2 heroes fall in love with each other, they will sacrifice themselves so the other lives. But should they become hateful, they can die by the hand of their own companion. I found the relationships that heroes develop throughout the journey the most interesting mechanic of the game. It gives so much flavor to the heroes and make them feel like actual individuals with their own feelings and motivations rather than soulless fighters. A hero that healed another that was about to die strengthens their bond and this little thing may cause them to fight more effectively together in the long run.   To summarize, I think Darkest Dungeon 2 is an excellent roguelike that offers a lot of exciting content that will keep you constantly on the edge with its strategic, well done and tense combat and with an intriguing story and amazing bosses that offer the most unique challenge I've ever experienced in a roguelike. If you happen to have played Darkest Dungeon 1 and wonder if you should give this game a try, DEFINITELY do so, as a hardcore fan of DD1, I feel like Darkest Dungeon 2 took everything that made DD1 great and IMPROVED it, better combat with improved visuals and mechanics, more fun micromanaging that doesn't take a ton of time like the hamlet, a more interesting meta progression with a TON of things to unlock without aimlessly grinding random generated dungeons, more story with the addition of playable hero backstories, overall a more enjoyable experience that is well worth your time.",1
138014324,1940340,"I have waited for the sequel to DD1 ever since it was announced, and having followed it closely. At first, I was surprised how different it was which may be the same feeling you have right now. There is no basebuilding, micro managment of roster and the 2D-corridors have been replaced by new 3D art of you driving a stagecoach instead. You pick 4 heroes and you are stuck with them through the run (expedition as its called in-game). You will get new heroes if one dies during the run, but its picked at random. Throughout the 5 acts the game has, each harder and substantially different from the rest you will fight different factions with their distinct looks and combat abilities. You will explore nodes to get better gear, more money, get story about your chosen heroes and through that unlock new skills you can equip them with. You wont collect portraits, busts etc. and gold has been replaced by 2 new currencies.  This is a roguelite, and as the game tells you in the beginning you are supposed to fail and its been woven into the narrative and by the excellent narrator of the returning June Wayne just like DD1. The roster is smaller with 12 heroes. but each and every hero has a unique path which highlights a specific aspect of their kit, which i enjoy since it makes each hero feel ""unique"" and highlights them in a way DD1 couldnt do due to its nature. 12 might sound small to what DD1 has, but each hero has 4 (3 really) paths and 11 unique skills. Some skills return, some are new, but all are thematic and simply ""fits"".  Music is catchy and the transition to 3D is excellent as it retains DD1 distinct style and manages to build further upon it by adding fluid movements to the skills you cast and more details in general. The roguelite elements of collecting candles makes every run worth giving it your all as the rewards are numerous and always makes you altering your approach to combat. The decision-making of skipping a fight, of taking a path over another, of managing stress, health and damage constantly keeps you on your toes. Difficulty is part of DD and it hasnt been lost here as a poor decision will have consequenses, but there are ways to make the game easier or harder, just as DD1. The combat is token-based, meaning for example that you will always hit your target unless your hero has a token that gives him/her a 50% penalty in aim.  The start is rough as you dont have any heroes, items, pets and other perks to be the most effective but oh boy will you notice just how much Red Hook has explored new mechanics and deepened those that worked for me in DD1. A tip: think of the bossfights like puzzles, the right hero in the right position can make all the difference and if you pay attention to your team composition, their quirks and relationships to one another, you will immidietly be rewarded.  Sure, the game is a bit priecy for a roguelite, but i know the developers will support this game for a long time and when they wont, the amazing mod community will pick up the torch (sadly, mods will come later, same goes for steam cloud saves i believe). There is a solid roadmap for the game which will elevate the game further. Ultimatly i am satisfied with DD2 both as a sequel and a roguelite as i never wished for ""more of the same"" which some reviews wish for but thats entirely up to you. What I know is that the most fun aspects of DD2 for me is the spotlight each hero gets, the music, art, the gameplay and decision making. Buy now, wait for sale...but make sure to get it sometime! Whatever you decide for, remember that many fall in the face of chaos, but not you, not today. PS: The Leper is still a chad, if not more so.",1
138014316,1940340,"Don't listen to the people crying that the game is isn't the same as the original, that's kinda the point of making a sequel. play it for yourself without the expectations of DD1 and you will have a truly immersive and enjoyable experience. Red Hook have stated that they are working on modding support, and in general, I feel they care about their game a great deal, so this game will only continue to improve with time, so buy in now and watch this game go from brilliant to even better",1

Its sad that a lot of  what made DD1 so impactful was disregarded, and all they kept was the art style (which is really good) and the base combat mechanics (which the managed to make feel more like a DD clone than actual DD combat).

The depth that the game has with it's diplomacy is really easy to understand and has lot's of options for the players and caters to many different play styles. The auto combat option is nice for the smaller fights. And exploration is also very rewarding. Players are given different ways to approach scenarios no matter what faction or alignment you have and it's really fun to try different things.

138017396,1669000,"Not that I won't still play this or that I think this isn't going to get better but, this is to give an assessment as an AoW3 player for others. Is it worth it now? Borderline...  This title is inferior to it's predecessor in more ways than it's superior. But lets talk about what it gets right. The improvements to netcode and desync are almost worth the price of the game itself. In 3 you constantly had to check your maps and compare. This monitors your games and does a reload when trouble happens.  Which generally works very well. However, it did literally destroy hours of work as this happened during the middle of a played battle and flipped all the results of the battle from winning it to losing. Which wouldn't have been bad had it not been a battle with the ruler involved which ended up killing him and making the entire empire defeated.   Aside from that, the game is a very mixed bag of doing things right and wrong. I'm a fan of using Steampunk Elves from AOW3. I greatly enjoyed this creation of mine. Trying to do it in AOW4 is extremely awkward as your character and empire is more fluid than rigid. You can learn all magics regardless of what your initial choices are. While this is nice in some ways, it destroys the purpose and time put into custom creation since all that does is define how your empire starts. In my attempts my Steampunk Elves turned into a bizarre mixture of nymph spawning angels that summon monsters from the void and yet still retain their good alignment.   Resource management I feel is more of a chore in 4 than 3. I definitely find myself starved more often than not and the whole Imperium system makes diplomacy, expansion, and creating new cities very cumbersome. Too much relies on it. I've not had one play through yet where I actually hit a positive stride and was able to focus on conquering or exploration. Great I made a shipyard but, I'm so starved that I can't risk allocating anything to building ships!  Attacking towns and conquering them feels a few steps back from AOW3. I can't just make my siege machines and go nuts.  Which was the entire point of creating elves with dwarven machines! Those are relegated to siege magic and you can't seem to learn it for awhile. Even worse is I've yet to be able to create my tanks that AOW3 had. My most powerful runthrough I got a hero who is a friend of ogres and then just became near invincible making armies with trolls and ogres. But, no tanks! I WANT MY TANKS!!!   Overall, this feels like the foundation of an ever expanding game that I feel may get better but, I'm a little cautious that they might lock all of it up behind paywalls. AOW3 is legendary, AOW4 seems to have identity issues. I hope it improves. There is some promise to it. Just can't really say I recommend it yet.",0
138017361,1669000,"A wonderful game to any fan of the turn-based strategy games, or for anyone looking to get into it. This game has an awesome in-depth mechanics and customization system for more advanced players, but can be automated and simple enough that new or casual players can enjoy the game without feeling completely overwhelmed. There's a great balance of exploration, diplomacy, warfare, character creation, and empire expansion/management that really scratches my brain itch and its' need to compulsively problem-solve and strategize on a grand scale. In addition to the mechanics, the graphics are beautiful, but not too advanced that a relatively older device couldn't handle. Of course there's a few bugs, and the game can crash from time to time, but overall this has been pretty minimal. Multi-player is actually much easier to coordinate than I was anticipating. I tend to drop connection fairly often, but was able to join back up to on-going sessions with relative ease (now, how long I actually stayed is a different story!) Multi-player can get a little laggy depending on the number of players you have, the complexity of your map, and how many world units are active, but again it's not too bad if you have a solid connection, and a relatively decent device to run it on. I've tried playing the game on my Steam Deck as well, and it's working pretty much the same as my PC -- but it does seem a little more buggy/crashy (for all the reasons listed above) at this point in development. Overall, for the game being as new as it is, the lag, bugs, and crashing frequency is not as bad as I had anticipated. I'm very impressed with this game, and will probably neglect all of my real life chores and responsibilities in order to spend as much time on it as possible.",1

138017072,1566200,"is it a roguelite? is it the best hockey game since NHL 95?  yes to both. Underpinning the ridiculous powerups and silly game mechanics (kazoo ftw) is an incredibly responsive yet simple and surprisingly nuanced hockey arcade game. Some things need improvement. Example: scoring on the goalie on final boss stage requires a rebound and put-back, ping pong style attack, which isn't the only way to build a team.  They need to add more power-ups, more replayability. A way to make 1 on 1 goals more feasible in the late game would be good too.  ALSO PLEASE MAKE IT SO WE CAN CUSTOMIZE HELMET COLOR OF THE BENCHWARMERS.

I wouldn't recommend this game unless you have someone you know to play as the commander or have another friend playing as the foot soldiers. Not being able to verbally speak to your commander beside an in game text chat makes the game very annoying as it is sometimes hard to get a vehicle when you can't verbally speak to your commander, I recommend that they add a voice chat feature for this.

138018409,1837580,"I'm quite the fan of Wales Interactive and felt as the game is recent and mixed on reviews i'd add to the pile of yes votes.   One playthrough so far, me and the other half really enjoyed it. Took about 65 minutes with 10 of those minutes getting a wasp out of the room.   Acting decent, well choreographed fight scenes, the characters are solid but predictable, effects mostly good but some of the green screen strangely takes me back to the 90's heyday of FMV (I love it for things like this though, whether the intention was to be ""so bad it's good"" I can't quite tell, this goes for other aspects of the game too). Really liked the prosthetics in one scene which I won't detail but it sort of ties in with one of the above points. Even a few laughs to be had too with some amusing parts to the script at times.   It does feel like the ending wasn't in mind when the theme was first conceived, like they started with no clear idea of where it was going to end, or how it was going to get there. I don't mean this in overly negative way, let's face it how many FMV games have done the same or at least given the impression they were written in that way?!  I am quite surprised at the harshness of criticism though, especially from some of the people posting who are fans of WI games or FMV as a genre.   I look forward to testing out other outcomes from the route my story took, even if it is as on-rails as claimed I don't see anything at this point that will disappoint me that wouldn't have disappointed me already.   I nearly didn't buy this due to reviews but glad I did now. Got a nice deal on it under ""complete my collection"" so I advise to save more than the 10% off at the moment if you already own full catalogue of their games. If you usually love these games, ignore the good and bad reviews and go in open minded to form your own opinion as you might well enjoy it like many have already.",1

138016801,1742020,"Good game considering it's ""made by fans for fans"" and it's free too! Tried out all characters in training mode for ~40m and I've noticed some unpolished edges that would make the game feel much better when improved upon. Sprite animations feel way too fast, it feels like they prioritized more animation frames over the quality of each frame. Just looked over some 3rd strike footage and the movement feels much more fluid with less frames(I don't expect 3rd strike levels of excellency in a free game, but some improvements would be nice). This is especially seen on each characters walking animations, they look freakish. Just open up 3rd strike and see how subtle walking animations are in comparison. Second thing that really irked me was the SFX, not sure if the voice effects were ripped from streams, but they feel lifeless and they are not synced well with the attack animations. The decision to use voice every second move over using it on every move seems counter intuitive on a game that is marketed towards fans of vtubers(not one of those, so I might be wrong) and just doesn't feel good when hitting an attack. Just look at some gameplay of Dudley from 3rd strike, it feels so natural when he shouts/exhales every attack.  There's also some mixed non pixelart sprites in gun animations(and maybe somewhere else too), it would look better if everything would be pixelart(and doesn't seem like it would be much work to add more pixelart'y sprites for gun animations for example). I won't comment much on the gameplay since I only tried every character in training mode as of now. If I find some bad things to say about it I'll probably add it here.  tl;dl fun game to try out(and it's free!), not a masterpiece by any means. p.s. forgot to add it has rollback!!! that's great!",1

138016577,1742020,"Something to consider: I'm not much of a Hololive fan, I'm a fighting game fan. I only see a few clips here and there. There are some personalities I like but I don't really watch 'em.  The game's free so it's totally worth giving a shot. The netcode isn't the best but it's stable enough, better than SFV's netcode. The game's quite clunky and has [u] NO [/u] QOL features whatsoever. I'm a weirdo who plays on analog but they neglected to add a deadzone config so us analogbros are severely handicapped against stick, box, dpad, and keyboard users. It also doesn't have a V-Sync option for those who have monitors with lower refresh rates. The game also has some weird performance issues, not sure what's up with that.  The balance is pretty awful but maybe I'm just bad, this game is quite unusual to me. It's an anime fighter that doesn't have much emphasis on footsies but it doesn't have air-dashes either apart from Coco Kiryu. Many characters don't have traditional air combos. It's like a very strange mixture of Skullgirls and JoJo HFTF. Fighting Botan feels like fighting Peacock but much worse because there's no way for some characters to close in on her effectively. Skullgirls has air-dashing and super-armour moves to close in on Peacock while she's zoning. Zoning in general is way too oppressive and powerful with the way the game works. It's only really a problem for characters built around zoning though. Sora's projectiles are also quite oppressive, however, Korone's projectiles are manageable and Suisei's projectile is utter trash.  It's a great game for beginners with its direction-input special button while still having substance for more experienced players by giving a meter bonus for players who use motion-inputs. Many moves feel pretty clunky and it's hard to tell when a character is negative or positive due to the inconsistency of the animations which is something that could be fixed but as of now, it's simply something to get used to. The training mode is really good, it has all the necessary features you'd need when labbing. The single-player content is also pretty good which is great for casuals who don't want to get bodied online (but if you don't get bodied, you won't learn and get better)  I'll recommend it because there's some dumb fun to be had with this game and I believe it can improve overtime, but as of now, don't take it seriously if you're a fighting game fan. It's not bad but it's just not good enough either. As of now, I'd consider this a kusoge. Just look at how messed up and buggy Suisei is.  Needless to say but please keep up the good work. I'm not a Hololive fan but a free beginner-friendly fighting game with rollback netcode that also awards veteran FG players is really exciting and I hope this game can reach a point where it's genuinely a viable fighting game to commit to.",1

In the end, real fun; Things I would like to see: - More patches than brings new items, enemis and most important, region. - The time of a run is too short ( instead of being on 3 inns it should be on 4 with the fifth being the mountain) - Confessions bosses should be harder and acts should take more time (Saw someone finishing the first act in the first 2 hours...) - It should be nice if we have some related crimson court stuffs. - It's too easy to run from a fight they should be a better way of limiting that. - Relation system should be slightly reworked because we have most of the time no control over it.",1

Like, I don't even feel upset anymore after getting crit for 35 damage by some random enemy, because who cares? I don't have to be afraid of losing the character I could feel attached to. In addition, if I understand it correctly (although I may be wrong, I've only played like two hours so far), you can just grind your progress, instead of losing a huge chunk in some runs  and then gaining just as much in others using new tools you gain access too, which also doesn't feel right in terms of the whole concept.  Gameplay doesn't feel very different at its core, although the damage cut buffs on the enemies are incredibly annoying and shouldn't be as frequent, imo.  I'm still probably going to play through the game, and it's going to be an okay experience, but it just won't be the same as the first game.

138018967,1940340,"I'm not one to typically write a negative review, but for this game I must.  For context, i've played well over 100hrs of the first game, and my complaints aren't around the punishing nature of the game as a whole but really, its changes from the first game to make this one significantly less fun.   This game steps away from the preperation mentality of the first game, where they punish you for being under-prepared, or haphazardly diving into a dungeon. Here you are simply punished for advancing in the game at all. The relationship system between teammates discourages the already slim selection of useful abilities in a run by giving YOUR PARTY INSANITY STACKS EACH TIME YOU USE THAT ABILITY. So now your units go insane, because you are choosing the quickest way to end an encounter. In the first game these mental breaks where something that the player could manage by being prepared, thinking ahead, and through skill. Now your most damaging ability is now useless unless you want to drive your entire party insane on the first leg of the journey. Sure its more challenging, but its def not more fun.   The coach system is bad. There's no functional point to it other than to again punish the player for things outside of their control, and to force the player into encounters because the player is simply advancing in the game. Sure it looks cool, but mechanically a simple map, would be better. So again, be as prepared as you'd like, but if you random into 3 broken wheel nodes, congrats! Your run is in peril. Again, this is not a fun challenge, since as players, we have little agency here other than break my wheel or break my hull.   The number of mobs with damage reduction feels bad, though this at least is something players can prepare for. The number of mobs with Deaths Door feels bad too, but again is something a players tactics can solve, however, is a another prime example of making game mechanics artificially harder.    There's more bad then good but get your ~1hr deep take and tell me i'm wrong before refunding.  Darkest Dungeon 1 with mods is 10000% more fun than this game as it stands. The devs didn't need to recreate wheel here and i'm extremely disappointed in how this game turned out.",0
138018818,1940340,"Darkest Dungeon Oregon Trail.   Yeah yeah, it's no longer a dungeon hellcrawler but a fun road trip where you and all your friends head out on a surreal metaphorical(?) journey to defeat Lovecraftian horrors and confess all of your sins. It's more polished, striking, well-realized and easy to get into than the first...  But everything has its price. And that price is, uh, ""smoothing out"" some systems. And this is a make-or-break-moment for a lot of DD1 fans.  Everything has been made simpler, the difficulty curve is smooth, and systems are introduced and developed upon in a carefully curated way. There are times where they went too far, like how basic items and heroes are locked behind meta-progression and how quirks are learned over time rather than generated with the character.  I can def understand DD1 fans looking at 2 and thinking the formula's been butchered for a mainstream audience or for ""a new experience"". But I dunno, I liked this game a lot better than 1. I never got into DD1 because it's weirdly coy with its systems and didn't have the best UI in the world. DD2 not only fixes many of those issues but puts a twist on the gameplay formula.",1

133966244,2151580,"A fun time with tons of confusion and lots to learn. Good times <3  Graphics: As it takes so many draws from vampire survivors it has no shame in continuing with the pixel art aesthetic tradition and from all the combos, abilities and whatever else i've seen, it does it well. It has a performance mode if there's too much screen clutter for you and some cool stuff to look at if you stick without the performance mode. By the end of me finishing my first 30 minute run my screen was near enough full of stuff i was throwing out with tons of damage going with it.  Game play: Again, its taken great inspiration from vampire survivors BUT (and that's a big but) it does enough differently to feel fresh. This isn't VS 2.0, its Infinite Tao! A game of not having a tutorial or a guiding light or honestly just even means of having a clue what you are suppose to be doing along with so much more. The synergies are fun to learn as the game doesn't give them to you clearly and took me a decent amount of time to figure out (i may just be dumb in fairness) but it leads to you just saying ""screw it, that looks cool and i'm pretty sure water and electricity seem like an intuitive combo"". It means you try out sooo many more items and it expands your knowledge of what might be good. There's a good amount to this game and i would say, give it a go and just refund in the very worst case.  Audio: There can be a lot going on on screen so i play with the volume on pretty low. I turned off the music to listen to spotify instead. The games a chill/intense at times game so i like to just chill out when i play it and listen to my own stuff. 10/10 jammers from spotify :p  Audience: The maximum run time for a run is 30 minutes, not including time you sit in menus so if you have a spare 45 minutes, want a chill time with not alot of thought going into actual game play and more into build creation. This. This is the game for you... There were times i was in the menus for longer than i was alive because i wanted to plan far enough ahead just to die lol.  PC Requirements: My work PC with a i5-3450 and a 750 ti crammed into it have managed to run the games on my break with some troubles towards the end til you flip to performance mode and its back to running smooth as ever. If you cant run this normally try the performance mode. Makes a HUGE difference.  Difficulty: The info is just not clear enough. Once you get it all its an amazing time but for the first section of the games time, you may feel like you have only half the information (especially for me as i just started testing stuff out rather than googling and really hard searching for info). Once you get passed that the games difficulty comes from building correctly.  Grind: Its infinite... tao... okay nvm :D  Story: I managed to figure out the game works i ain't ever figuring out if this has a story lmao.  Game Time: about 45 minutes every time you beat the game and less for every death... or more dependant on if you keep pushing play again :p  Price: £2.49 is worth every penny. If you really cant be bothered to pay that, wait til sale. You'll just be missing out til a sale though. Big sadge.  Bugs: *insert John Travolta meme*.

It has a nice balance of relaxing and intense. It's like you feel both at the same time.      The ability to sell your weapons and passives means there is a lot of room to adapt as you play.      If you don't like how easy the run is going, you can increase the difficulty or summon a boss mid-play.

Personally, I've encountered only a few crashes and hangs due to AI turns not processing. Despite these minor issues, I've thoroughly enjoyed the 18 hours I've logged in the game. My advice is to appreciate the efforts of the developers in fixing these issues.  Difficulty: The difficulty level may vary for each player. In my experience, I typically face over 100 enemy armies by turn 20, but others may have a different experience.  Game speed: The game's speed is decent, and I find it suitable for my playing style. While some features may take some time to get comfortable with, once you become familiar with them, you'll be able to make decisions more quickly. Some people complain about the lack of diversity, but I personally find it to be enough, especially given the game's $50 price point.  Experience: As a long-time fan of the RTS genre, I've played many 4X RTS games, each with its own unique twist and attractions. While I cannot compare this game to other Age of Wonders titles or other 4X games, I believe it's a great addition to the genre. With the level of customization and specialization available to players, I'm satisfied with the game's depth. Although I may desire a bit more in some areas, I'm happy with the game overall. I'm confident that any customization or diversity enhancements that I'm looking for will come via DLC or mods. Even if the game's depth remains as it is, I'm still eager to log many more hours of playtime.  Closeout:  This game may not be for everyone, especially considering the RTS genre's niche audience. However, if you're willing to pay the price and want to experience a new and fantastical world, I highly recommend giving this game a try. I'm confident that you won't regret it, as long as you're not looking for a specific type of experience.",1

The ""mysterious caller"" trope in PlayWay theft games (Thief Sim 1, American Theft 80s) is still good and fun surprisingly.  The game is more well-made than I thought it would be, since I have seen a history of bad sequels. The visuals are better, and it just seems more high quality. It also runs well on my potato pc.

138020349,1566200,"As a hockey (and hockey game) fan, like many others on PC, I've been craving a good hockey game to come back on the platform. Similar to Super Blood Hockey, I think this has some potential as an arcade-style hockey game, but it misses the mark on a few things that take away the enjoyment. As of now, I can't recommend the game in its current form.  The campaign is pretty frustrating in that as soon as you lose you get sent back to the beginning and only then can you upgrade your core player. I'm not sure if the bench players get upgraded as well, or if you can upgrade other stats - the game doesn't really make it clear. Why is the path through the campaign always the same? As a roguelite game, there should be some random paths implemented, different opponents added, and so on. In this game, it's always the same, which gets frustrating and boring very quickly. Adding different branches on a larger map, letting you participate in skills tournaments or other challenges on your way, might be a fun thing to do. For example, you might challenge some people on a pond hockey game with a different sized rink and some funky rules (no goalies, and only a small target to hit). Or there might be a skills competition, where you pick which events you participate in for a chance to improve a bunch of different attributes. Maybe with different branches, at the start of the campaign all the arenas and other locations are hidden from you, but over time you can upgrade your team's ""scouting"" abilities (maybe adding a coach attribute) and you can reveal what those paths have as achievable bonuses so you can better pick which path to go on. The way it is now though, you have very little choice in which path you go on, essentially being railroaded through the campaign... I hate facing the same opponents over and over again.   Reaching checkpoints where you can visit the shop and not have to start all over again when you lose would be nice as well.  Another thing that is important to the game is... how do you score goals? In the practice mode, they don't explain it. They also don't teach you how to use each of the special abilities. How do I use the yo-yo effectively? It's not explained. Does deking or doing east-west passes for a one-timer actually improve your chances of scoring, or is it a dice-roll in the background? Is it better to just take a slapshot and rely on your player's power, or is it better to do a wrist shot and rely on accuracy? None of this is explained, and even someone like me - who is intimately familiar with hockey - can't really tell. I don't understand the point of the Tomahawk ability, either. Sure, you can drop one or two players in front of you with your stick, but usually the AI just takes the puck from you since you can't quickly switch to another player once your Tomahawk player has lost their stick. What's the point? If you added some practice for each skill, and showed us how to use each effectively, then it'd be much more useful. Also, as someone else said in their review, adding more abilities and making it a completely random selection just leaves me with a higher chance to get abilities I don't want at all... kind of defeats the purpose.   Maybe I haven't gotten far enough in the game to know how to do this, or if it's possible, but I would've thought we should be able to swap out all our players for star players eventually, rather than just having one single star player on the team. Shouldn't that be the goal of this game, to eventually make a superstar team that goes all the way to a championship? If not then maybe there should be a Campaign+ mode where you can utilize all the unlocked players in your lineup and swap them out as the game progresses and unlock more.   Your defense is basically useless. They don't knock players down, block passes, or perform takeaways. When you take over the nearest player, they don't seem to do anything while skating backwards, and the transition to skating forwards with the attacking player is too slow. The AI is always able to avoid me, or pass to an open player, 99% of the time. If there's a technique to this then put it in the practice/tutorial! Otherwise, you have to change it. The only technique I've found to make my defense somewhat effective is to give one of them the random ability to seek out the other team's players and bodycheck them, and then I always let the AI use that player since they seem to be way better at bodychecking the other AI than I am.  Not being able to upgrade your goalie seems like a significant oversight, as others have mentioned. Maybe getting a superstar goalie, or one who can better stop special abilities, would be a good addition.  All in all, the game started to scratch my itch for a simple hockey game that reminded me of the old SNES NHL 90-something games, but ultimately if there was a choice between playing them in an emulator on PC or playing Tape to Tape, I'd probably still choose the old NHL games. There are definitely ways to improve it, and I hope the Early Access will allow them to try some bold changes in the game behind the scenes and eventually give us a game that's both challenging and enjoyable.",0
138020159,1566200,Its like a combination of Nhl 94 with NHL Hitz adding rogue like elements. What's not to love?,1
138019850,1566200,"Excellent hockey gameplay and an interesting roguelite format to keep things interesting. Early access means that the game still needs balancing (especially some boss fights) and it's a little shallow, but well worth your money at this point for the hockey gameplay alone - a super-fun arcade version of hockey like old school NHL games. Really looking forward to playing this further on expert difficulty and with different team builds.",1

138021155,1494420,"It's fun but has many areas where it can improve. Given time I think this game can be great.  1. The map needs better interactivity in FPS mode. At minimum, filters to spot things against clutter and a way for non-commanders to refer to the map (e.g. map coordinates or beacons). 2. The ammo count and health bars are hard to see against the wasteland environment. 3. Generic communication keys for FPS players to communicate with the commander (""Need assistance!"" and ""Need a vehicle."", as well as something to mark players that used these commands on the commander's map). 4. Looks like the chat bugs and only the most recent line updates after a point. 5. Chat updates in general. It's functional but is missing many expected features. 6. Need an auto-run or auto-forward key. 7. Select all units key. 8. Structures that players can interact with (e.g. watchtower, barricades) might add some more FPS/commander interactions. 9. I think an armory might be a more suitable approach than player classes. 10. Game is a bit slow on the commanders' side; might need to work the numbers to make commanders do more.  Might be some more here and there, but that's the crux of things so far.",1

138020815,1494420,"After having played for several hours, I have to say the game has significant potential. For those with a knack for RTS, you'll get a kick out of it and can include your buddies that are more keen for first person shooters. It may be riddled with glitches and bugs, but that's a given with games being optimized during early access. With the devs commitment, progress, and continued updates, this game will definitely introduce a new stage for RTS hybrids.  If you want to support the dev and the games progress, I'd say give it a shot. If you're looking for a complete game with few issues, give it a couple more months to a year before hopping in. Like I said, elements are still being added, glitches are still getting fixed, but the developer is very motivated and always looking for feedback on everything.   If you are considering getting this game, I would definitely recommend hopping on the discord server prior just to get an idea of the game's mechanics and ongoing issues. There is no tutorial and the learning curve is very barebone.  All in all, really looking forward to seeing what Silica will become.",1

138020273,1494420,The only good bug is a dead bug!,1
138020954,2002220,"This game is a blast! It's somewhat different from the other bullet heaven games in that enemies will teleport, shoot, kick, lunge, breathe flame and so on, rather than just zoom in on you. Positioning is really important, as a lot of attacks are directional, and the necromancer has a really cool weapon in the form of a ball and chain that swings in relation to how you move your character!  It's definitely tougher than some of the other games in the genre and I've had to grind the first map hard to unlock most of Bogadyr's upgrades (the 'warrior') but each upgrade feels meaningful and you can notice a substantial difference on the battlefield. Attacks hit hard and play satisfying sounds when they connect adding to a really smooth gameplay.  As for the maps themselves, at EA release, there's only two - the first map is outdoor and seems infinite, whilst the second is a catacombs map and has hallways, so it's not just a 'big square'.  Bosses fight with unique moves and are really tough, especially when you encounter them for the first time, but this is a good thing as they're not boring! So far I've only beaten the first two on the outdoor map!  It looks like they're planning six characters and four maps for the full release, but I do hope they expand on this as that does feel light, content-wise, as with the sheer volume of grinding I'm doing so far, it would be good to unlock more maps, gameplay modes and secrets etc. But this doesn't impact my enjoyment as it's EA and anything can happen!  TL/DR - a great bullet heaven if you're looking for a harder challenge in a dark world with some interesting characters and actual enemy mechanics.",1
138018853,2002220,"Overall I think it has a lot of promise and its just a few teething issues.  Game balance feels a bit rough so far, the early game is brutal. Not brutal in a ""I'm not great at the game yet"" but rather you don't have any talents unlocked so you literally just die to not being fast enough or having zero health regeneration. Enemies dive you and mobility is emphasised but at the cost of damage which is also emphasised, its a lose lose situation right now.  After unlocking several talents it becomes more playable but then you run into the overloaded abilities issue where you can only choose from 3 talents per and only have 3 rerolls. So the math is always against you getting decent damage output early game, then the XP scaling drops off too quick, even by level 20 you will be wiping the screen with enemies and it still takes forever to level up.   I think there needs to be a slight XP boost (As a level 1 talent?) and at least an additional ability to pick from per level, 8 abilities (Not including passive ones) is a lot to level up 5 times each. An additional reroll talent perhaps.  And the biggest issue is the hit boxes, they are confusing at the best of times. Some enemies such as the mimic are tall and thin, but you start taking damage being within its sprite box opposed to its actual pixels hitting the player. The tree boss is a big offender of this. Hit boxes are always tricky but I think they need to be smaller on all enemies to give leeway instead of taking weird angle damage. I rather be able to clip into them by a few pixels then to be basically no where near them and take damage. The diving enemies really make this an issue, with all the enemies bouncing and being pushed about you don't get a lot of maneuverability.   Enemy projectiles should be destructible, they follow you so closely and more often than not I just tank the damage because avoiding them is almost always pointless in the games combat. I think they should have health of their own so they aren't instantly destroyed, but in its current state they are just unfun.  Bogatyr suffers from a lot of reliable vertical damage, with the current spread of talents and abilities its hard to get any kind of consistent vertical damage that will allow you to clear enemies from below you.  Stunning should pause enemy attack cooldown timers, had several instances where I stun an enemy, get close to attack them, they unstun straight into a dash attack. Despite stunning them immediately after their initial dash attack. Stunning in its current form is more of a punishment than an advantage.  Flesh Golem is kind of a terrible fight at the moment, getting in range to bait out its attack then immediately unable to get back in range because of the swarming enemies to have their close attack reset as soon as you get close again is kind of awful. Its another situation where I burn my hp to kill it quickly than to play to its mechanics. I get you can just move down so it can't melee attack but the lack of vertical attack on Bogatyr is again a problem.  The only thing I'd like added is some kind of global talents that apply to all characters, such as movement increase, gold gain increase or base damage increase. Something to reward me for playing other characters and make playing another character less grindy at the start.",1

138021069,1667180,"ok so this game has serious issues, First of it crashed 4 times on me trying to load into the map after the main menu. Second when i finally got this game to start in a map and actually get to play this game it made my pc gpu ""which is only a few weeks old and basically brand new "" make sounds it never made before like a jet engine struggling to breath or sounding like it was gonna blow up  and this is just an overview game and is not a high demanding graphics game, actually it looks more like 2006 xbox 360 game. my pc has no problems handling high demanding graphic games such as resident evil for example so i don't see why this game should make my gpu sound that way . i hate leaving bad reviews and especially when i barley played the game but i don't want to see anyone's 1000 dollar pc crap out because of a generic 8 dollar game that barley works . this should have been an early access game first so do not recommend this game to anyone in its current state at 8 dollars alone hell i wouldnt even recommend it if the game was free! The dev has a lot to fix on this game if he wants it to actually go somewhere. i will be refunding it for now and il see if the dev puts in effort to fix how this game runs and not making pcs sound like they are gonna self destruct than i will give it a second chance and see if it is good enough to change the review from negative to positive",0

138020043,1730650,"I can't recommend this game right now as it is overall just a bad experience. Me personally loading was extremely long to the point I sat on the couch and watched Youtube just to wait for the menu to pop up so I can load some more. Multiplayer seems dead and even if it wasn't I tried loading into my own lobby and the loading time was even more outrageous. I can run any VR game fine and with this being low-end when it comes to graphics I would doubt my setup is the issue. On top of all of this the physics feel terrible especially in combat. When I hit a zombie with a baseball bat I want them to react to it like I actually hit them with a baseball bat. Instead it just plays a stupid animation like you hit them with anything else, repeat that 5 times and they play another animation and fall down. I'm 6 foot yet I am towered upon by the zombies which are supposed to be ""normal people"" turned into zombies. It feels like I walked into the NBA draft when the zombie-apocalypse happened. Anyways, I plan to refund the game as I cannot see myself playing it again and enjoying it as 3/4 of the time I played already was just loading.

138020990,1742020,"Man, I remember seeing the development progress of this game waaaaay back in the day when I used twitter, and I am really REALLY happy to see it finally hit steam! As a long time fan of Hololive (God, it's gonna be 4 years this summer, how time flies...) I am always super stoked to see the amazing fan projects that this community makes get the recognition they deserve. So, about the game now; it has a lot of potential and, most importantly, it's really a TON of fun, despite some small rough edges that I am sure will get ironed out as the game receives more updates. The movesets are actually GREAT but quite limited in size, but in a way I think this could overall be a net positive, as I feel like this game is the PERFECT gateway for someone that is not familiar with fighting games to get into the genre. Despite this, you can still pull off some pretty flashy and complex stuff with the tools you are given once you get the hang of your character. Hitboxes and especially inputs could be improved a bit, but as I said, I am confident everything will get smoothed out with time, and regardless, for the low low price of 0 euros and 0 cents I'd say it's absolutely worth it. The only real downside I can speak of is that the roster is VERY small, only 8 characters. I hope more will be added as time goes on, cause as of now the lack of variety is really the only thing slightly holding it back. But hey, at least the one true BEST IDOL Suisei is in it, so all is good, and she has the specific fighting style that I prefer to boot, so it's like stars aligning (hah, get it?). It's so nice to finally have a new good fighting game to sink some hours into. So in conclusion: Game is fun, it's free, the artstyle and music are amazing, just GET IT. DO IT!",1

I had my party deal the final blow and because of new mechanics the boss just want on death's door. It immediately annihilated 3 of my party members with 3 attacks not giving me a chance to retaliate or stand a chance on a fight i should have already beat.

138023791,1940340,"As a long time fan of darkest dungeon and a purveyor of the finest ""The Last Crusade"" build. I was very disappointed by this game.  Beyond it leaving out the main character, it also decided to change how it represents information by default to symbols. I don't know why. I want to see how my blight stacks. Now I have to move my mouse over it to actually see it and that's sooo much effort. There might even be a setting to change that in the menu's but, I can't be bothered to find it.  Did two runs so far. They seem to have simplified the builds and overall mechanics of the parties. That you can't seem to make an only man at arms or only highwayman build disappointed me. I dislike sequels arbitrarily lowering your build options for stupid reasons like plot and narrative.   Any who it's a worthy successor of the series that tries a lot of new stuff.So far it seems to accomplish it well. I just wish that the inherent mechanics didn't limit your builds options so thoroughly. I don't see how they are going to surmount that. Unless they start selling a massive amount of dlc's as like singular characters and their stories.Which would be kind of money grubbing depending on how they do it. But, we shall see!",1

But what about the lack of a story? Don't worry, there are world quests that provide a bit of narrative and unique objectives to mix things up.

138025529,1494420,"The RTS/shooter hybrid genre is one that's very small and marred by unsuccessful games.  They're intriguing on paper, but tend to be poorly executed; some of this may be due to having to ""herd the cats"" as a commander and getting players to cooperate as intended.  Silica seems to have struck a very solid balance in this respect, where most of the force agency is retained with the commander, and a much smaller proportion of units occupied by players. Other issues, such as most of the player unit's time being spent walking from A to B, will be harder to fix - this is perfectly fine in an RTS where you order a unit to walk across the map while you micromanage other things, but not particularly entertaining when you're the one that has to do the walking. Additionally, the shooter component feels exceptionally arcade-y, very much akin to classic Battlefront without any of the customization options. They may expand on that in the future, but as of now, it's very bare-bones.  Even at a $19.99 price point, the current amount of content really isn't worth it.  It's really just enough content for a free demo.  Silica is an interesting game, and it seems they've got a good baseline, but given the sordid history of early access games it's meaningless to try and predict how well it'll be developed going forward.  As such, rating it as-is, it's currently not recommended.",0

And that's good - a game that challenges you until you crest on hilltop, only to be faced with another Confession chapter that seems even harder.

I've failed MANY runs already, but it feels like its only fortified my resolve to think wisely & creatively on how to play.  I help playtest this game towards the end of Early Access and what's encouraging about a game like this is the team that put this together.

That aside, I really enjoyed my first playthrough. Poor Dismas did not make it.   If i had to pick something to nag about it would be only have two possibilities when reaching max stress: either resolute or meltdown. One of the things I enjoyed the most about DD1 was all the different states a hero could enter into when 100 stress was reached, with each mood having a significant and different effect. Would they be courageous, powerful!? Or fearful, paranoid etc. Simplifying it down to just resolute or meltdown takes away the excitement of the most defining moment (for me) of darkest dungeon game.  Its a very fresh and thematic approach, and I applaud the developers for being brave enough to make big changes to an already very successful formula. Great stuff!",1

Also - horrible relationship system between characters, you've got no reason to care about any of it since runs are so short; in DD1 you had characters that could be in your party for 30+ hours of playtime and you actually cared not to lose them and put up with their developed issues and flaws, in here if anything goes wrong you just restart and get a new one - atrocious artstyle changes, looks like a ""we have Darkest Dungeon at home"" mobile game now; why change the proportions of the characters so much for no reason at all?

The puzzles are not obvious at all at first and remind me of Myst in terms of the complexity, but once you figure it out, then it ends up looking very obvious at that point forward.  Graphically, it's very beautiful environment wise, and the character models are nice, although the facial expressions are a little odd, and some of the animations are a little flimsy but this is pretty minor in the grand scheme of things.  For a physics based platformer, I found it satisfying and fun and I think this game will be really fun with speedrunners down the line. There are some points in the game where you have to be very exacting with your reactions, so speedrunning it will end up being a lot of fun.

138026630,1494420,"Reminds me a lot of Natural Selection 1/2, i feel almost as if this is a natural upgrade from NS as the inclusion of spawnable NPC units for commanders to use is massive. no more do commanders have to hope the players listen to them, now they can just tell an NPC to go scout for batarium/biomass. The game also benifits from having an AI commander if no one is currently in the slot, although having a player in the commander slot is always better. Both the bugs and humans are fun to play as. Its mentioned in some other reviews but the Harvesters to tend to get stuck occasionally which is annoying, but players can easily teleport to them and pilot them to unstick them. the game is currently pretty rough, i wish they would tone down the bloom a bit. Overall im looking forward to what updates come for this game.",1
138026537,1494420,Extremely rough game.  - No new player tips at ALL. - UI is small and mostly useless. - No full controls/keybinds guide. - Commander view is minimal and has no RTS elements or assistance.   Overall not worth a penny right now.,0
138026533,1494420,"(Disclaimer that I do recommend but not if you are playing solo. This will only be fun with friends) Really unique gameplay concept that works well for how simple it is. It is VERY simple so far and the UI is extremely basic. However I'm definitely giving this a positive review since this is a really cool genre that I want to see get support. I played coop and had a really good time, definitely needs more UI, more content.  One thing its really missing is hit register feedback. When you shoot in FPS mode there is no hit registration so you're not sure if your landing shots or if the enemy is taking damage.",1

I'm loving it, has a great core to it but small disclaimer, it's very very early access.  Some people might turn their nose up at this but the dev is one man that's worked on this passion project of his for 5-10 years.  He's using the new Bohemia interactive incubator program which gives him advertising and other things to help the game that would be too overwhelming for a small indie.  Many updates are soon to come, most excitingly air units which will revolutionize the game play.  He's very involved with the community on discord.  If your willing to take a $20 flyer on this project to support it and live your dreams out piloting tanks, armored cars, crabs, scorpions, and huge tanky bugs your going to have some fun.

Imagine a fan-made game, thrown out for free, and people ragging on it like it came from Bandai Namco.  As for the actual game, there is no difficulty setting, no timer setting, and no continues or retries. This does pose a problem as it makes everything a bit of a gauntlet and you definitely feel it when you lose because of it. Even a simple arcade run lost due to a simple mistake will have you restart from the beginning.  The fighting in itself is pretty good. The archetypes do what you'd expect and it's not as clunky as I've seen said. Seems more fluid to me than the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure fighting game on the PS3.   As a whole, if you like Hololive and you like fighting games ina way you dont take yourself too seriously, this seems like a game you may wanna look into. Remember it's a fan-made game, and for people without the funding of the big guys, I believe they did a good initial job.  Game would be a little less stressful if we had continues and an adjustable timer, and a difficulty slider for the folks who want it.",1

138028384,1940340,"I've played a lot in beta, through some changes.  Vast changes from DD1, major improvements since Beta, and several other patches.  I used to like this game, now I love it. The learning curve is a little steep, it might make your head turn for a little bit. But, once you get the hang of what the little icons do, you'll be fine! and the Alt-button can be used on enemies you're fighting, and to learn literally anything you'd like. PLUS there's a bunch of other features that show you ""what"" everything does.  Gameplay? Use ability, click enemy/buff teammate, Bam, you're done. Your heroes get better as you do ""their"" stories. Which sometimes involves a little story combat, which I enjoyed. The teams, and structures are very diverse, you really have to make use of everything you've got, and plan a little ahead, as you understand what you're facing. Say, ""enemies here bleed me a lot, let's get some bandages"", or even change ability set-ups pre-fight, for a boss battle, or even a side battle. Though, not always necessary.   Developers even made the game a little bit easier than what it used to be, by unlocking certain abilities faster, or outright skipping some stuff, and making some stories a lot less silly, where, if you misunderstood the assignment, you'd just have to wait til the next time you pick the hero to progress.  I love these changes, it's great to see the devs doing really good work on improving the core mechanics and gameplay of the original, and making a banger sequel.  Design is great, the art is still top notch, the actions *feel* a lot more impactful than in 1, and music is memorable. Though, a score or two can get on your nerves after a lot of playing.   There are a few weird things, like ""tokens"" and positive/negative effects that aren't super easy to understand, or, are really told about. BUT, that's no big deal.   If you're new, you should definitely try it. If you're returning, you should definitely try it. If you're like me, and cba to grind so long, (semi-grindy, but significantly better than pre 1.0) it's still fun in stages.",1

A lot of negative reviews seem to be centered around DD2 being a lesser version of DD1. I've played DD1 for almost 900 hours, and I can say with confidence that this isn't true. DD2 is not a ""new version"" of DD1, so if you want more DD1, probably best to go for some mods.  DD2 does, however, mix up the gameplay while still being familiar. Characters, skills, and the combat system isn't totally alien, yet you'll be learning new things to master it. The game is set up more like a traditional roguelike, with ""runs"" that last roughly 2-3 hours, presenting numerous challenges and interesting decisions as you prepare your team to face whichever boss you intend to face. The game is highly enjoyable, with layers of challenge I'm still keen to go into, including official ""torchless"" modes.

Imagine being responsible for maintaining like six frying pans and four pots of boiling water in a kitchen, but you have the supernatural ability to read the likelihood, in exact percentage points, of each item boiling over or burning at any given time. So the job requires your whole attention, but in a way where you're more engaged than stressed; basically you're getting to constantly mini-gamble on probabilities while sort of keeping an eye on everything holistically and serving up food.

138026697,1940340,"Darkest Dungeon 2 gameplay-loop wise is a big change from the first, switching to a run-based system like most other rogue-likes instead of the lengthy campaign its predecessor had.   From the start Red Hook have stated Darkest Dungeon 2 will be very different from the first game, that they did not want to make ""Darkest Dungeon 1.5""  I love Darkest Dungeon as a series, and the fact that Darkest Dungeon 2 is so different means the first game will always be relevant. I will likely be playing both games on and off for years to come.  That said, fans hoping for a DD 1.5 will be disappointed I think but watch some gameplay and just give it a fair shot before giving up on it. As a general warning this game is overall harder than the first game. Learn from your failures, do not be discouraged. Like the first game, sometimes you'll lose and it can be devastating.  TL:DR - Highly recommended both for fans and newcomers. If you don't like difficult games or don't have the patience to learn them you probably won't get much out of this one.",1

The game offers great graphics with sharp detail, and SFX and special animations i haven't seen a game accomplish before! The first person is definitly more adrenaline inducing than commander mode in my opinion, but its also a much slower start than playing commander. While the maps are vast and spacious, friends and bots should keep you placing 1 foot in front of the other whole time. follow the commanders orders and communicate for the most fun of games. Single player has got to be my favorite while being able to switch between first person and commander RTS mode at my will, it makes it fun to see how certain battles play out from different POV. The game is new and early access so it has a couple bugs like the light machine gun buggy not being able to attack a goliath. why im using those to kill a goliath, dont ask.. lol. You also got troops not going where you click sometimes which confuses you when you are looking for reinforcements. but a simple re-click fixes that. Other than that i havnt noticed other bugs.

I'm sure you can do the math there - not sure why the developer could not  2) Human harvesters constantly get stuck due to bath pathfinding, Units in general constantly get stuck due to bad pathfinding  3) Lag is horrible at any large number of units  4) The Alien faction is a total disaster - their weakest units are actually their strongest units because they can just burrow underground and become instantly invulnerable.. they'll just get under a tank, go underground and let your AI teammates destroy their own tank with literally nothing you can do to stop it  5) The Human faction can get locked by having their Refineries destroyed, as in no way to come back from it at all - they can also be locked by having their HQ destroyed from building anything at all - so there's multiple ways to softlock games  6) Aliens usually will win because they already have economic advantages from their harvesters not being broken, and their starting unit being able to exploit the game, so with any 2 evenly match commanders the aliens will pretty much always win  7) There's no way to make groups of units, the RTS side of the game is completely lacking any kind of QOL tools  ....

138029863,1269300,"This game rules and can only get better with development. Very small amount of bugs, none that i've seen lasted and/or were game breaking, so for a game still in development i have high hopes. I wish the AI bots were a bit more either smart or clearly indicated about their actual current actions with maybe an icon? I don't know, but they get ""stuck"" for lack of a better word doing certain tasks when there's clearly other things that should be prioritized. Real life players in the later stages in the current state have to swap between the main damage/support roles you spec for in order to meet the needs of the more dire situations.  That said, the loot they have that i've experienced so far is varied enough to be fun to hunt certain things for, and the pooled money system and costs makes the coop feel even more social. Graphics are easy on the eyes, and you can really get through the beginning with decent cooperation, however after playing a few 30 min - 1 hour runs I noticed it jumps significantly in difficulty once you hit the 3rd zone, but in way that's rewarding if you are cooperating well enough; by then it's kind of a check on how well you're actually working together.   Even when people take what seem to be the early meta crew composition: 2 gunners/2 support, you still get into situations where things go wrong (someone sucked out into space, bombs, repair/ammo/battery item drops from running into another crew member at a certain speed, attacks that create 2-3 multiple repair jobs simultaneously, invaders, etc.) and everyone has to be slightly flexible in what they're doing at any given moment to actually keep your ship's Permanent HP/hull up. The only person I met that finished an entire run i've met said to prioritize repairing over damage (tip: you can use a repair kit and ""tap"" spots that need repair to reset the Permanent Damage countdown bar timer, and also use repair pulse modules for the same effect). The trick is to use the time left *after* maintaining anything needed on the ship, to then hit the guns and to do your damage. Lastly, the pacing is great because you can basically pause in between fights as long as you want to recover, reload, repair, or just have everyone take a 5 min break before continuing. Very casual.   Still haven't been able to beat the game, but have gotten quite far. Biggest problem i've heard from everyone i've played with is lack of players to actually be able to get 4, so give it a shot!  FFO: FTL, Overcooked, Plate Up!,",1

I think the last game I played in this genre was VA-11 Hall-A. I don't think this game lives up to that expectation, but that's also an unfair bar to set. I would just say that my biggest frustration with the game is that I couldn't just casually enjoy the game and get the good ending. I only managed to get 5/6 project files completed on my own. After looking up how to do the last one, it seems so unnecessarily obtuse that I would rather it didn't exist. But that's just my opinion.   Aside from this, everything else seems well crafted to build out a story I've vaguely watched unfold over a series of twitter and patreon posts.

138030254,1742020,"this is part of the new wave of propaganda the japanese have made. vtubers, or as i like to call them, vtumors, are part of the new wave of making young american men, into weak, depressed coomers that only consume anime content and jerk off all day, doing nothing productive. instead of getting a job, serving in the army, or going to church, they instead watch these vtubers and are saying stuff like ""oh shes so kawaiiii!!!!:3333"" and donate money to these prostitutes, making ""livestreaming"" and ""gaming"" a more viable ""job"" than something legitimate like being a doctor, a truck driver, or a lawyer. american men went from reading the bible with their wives, having a house and kids at 25, to being lonely 30 year old cooming to a high pitched anime girl screaming while playing video games. the biden administration has done NOTHING to help out these american men to do better with their lives, and is instead donating money to the wrong people. people are willing to pay for vtumor branded WATER, and that is outrageous. instead of buying something useful, like land, a gun, or nice clothing, they instead buy WATER with an anime girl on it. most of these vtubers dont even hold american believes! they just show their breasts on stream while screaming like a kid, and people donate thousands to them, and then complain that taxes are too much! anime was already the downfall of the west, making the american youth weak and into FICTIONAL girls. why not get a real, loving christian wife? she would treat you better than whatever these streamers are trying to be. i work 40 hours a week, and most likely make less than these ""entertainers"", even though they just sit around all day playing video games. i have a wife and kids to feed, have no free time of my own, and these streamers make a boatload of money just by doing the same thing my son does! i found him watching one named ""korone"" and it was the dumbest thing i've ever seen, im disappointed in this generation. why dont kids play outside anymore? these vtubers are clearly made for children or young teens, tricking them into thinking anime is okay, with their cute and provocative designs, degrading the brain to the point they have to coom all day to them, all while making money off that scummy tactic. if they taught jesus's teachings, i would be more accepting of them, but they dont. hillarys leaked emails stated that she wanted ""cute anime characters"" to trick children with, and this is just that. if the future generations are full of sexless, depressed lonely american men, i will no longer be a patriot, as it will be the death of america.",0

138028961,2055910,"One of the best purchases I've made on Steam for under $5. It's a very well crafted arcade game that's quick to learn but tough to master. The survival mode is randomly generated but the challenge scales up consistently. The challenge modes were a fun addition that rewards strategic approaches and I highly recommend giving them a try because they unlock the skins you see in the trailer. Both modes have leaderboards with Steam list integration, which adds replay value and community. Finally, Billy Mills made some great music for this and I hope he composes for more games.   If you're on the fence, buy this game.",1

Practice patience, though, as if you click too soon you will be heading in a totally unintended direction towards certain disaster and death.  Which will inspire you to push retry and play again.   The goal is simple, go straight and avoid obstacles, but the getting to the end of the level can be the hard part.

138031347,1566200,"Simple fun and silly, last hockey game i enjoyed that way was NHL 3 on 3 arcade but Tape to Tape is more of a NHL 94 gameplay. The added roguelike elements help the game in every way.  The content that is out is great and fairly polished. love humor, well designed themed teams, solid ""boss"" games. The only thing the game lacks is more content which i don't doubt will come with updates like most early access roguelikes.  overall super fun if you needed a hockey game and love roguelikes. 8.5/10",1

One thing me and my friend found out is that enemies weapons are too hard to destroy and they repair it really quick so we cannot even do anything else than reload our weapons to kill enemies.

138030838,2384850,"Bottle is an update on one of Tonguc Bodur's earlier games.  It is extremely short (20-30 mins), so there is no save function. I would describe this as a meditative walking simulator.  You listen to a woman reflecting on her marriage and what could have been.  The excellent narrator tells the story in poetry and the prose is easy to understand. Walking through snow covered terrain and majestic scenery enhances the sadness that the narrator is feeling.  The wintry landscape of her marriage has to change into spring for her own sanity and growth.  The mourning of a failed marriage and the guilt and regret that accompanies it is highlighted in her inner struggle to be free.  The letting go of her dream is hard.  I'm sure this will resonate with many divorced people. Tonguc's  graphics are excellent as usual and the accompanying music is lovely.  A nice touch is that you come across 'burning bushes' which accelerate your walking if you want to go faster.  The downside is that it affects any screenshots you take. If you want a much slower paced walk in the snow and want to chill (literally!), this is an ideal game for you.  There is minimum interaction and quite a bit of soul searching.  A gentle reflective walking sim is just the tonic you need. Highly recommend for those who want to experience a short zen game.  8/10",1

It sounds like there's some bugs here and there, I've not encountered many. Some people are reporting that their currency and/or saves are being erased, but it sounds like the devs are working on fixing that and are handcrafting save files for the players that experienced that bug.

I’m usually a hit it and quit it if I’m not good at it kind of gamer, but this game has me hooked and I’m improving with each round.   Also, It’s perfect for the Steam Deck and plays like a dream! Solid 60 FPS and ~6 hours of battery life.",1

138031702,2055910,"Most of what I know of Poosh is from watching others play it, but from the bit I have had my hands on it, I can already tell I am going to enjoy this game quite a lot.  It's very aesthetically pleasing, especially for fans of the synthwave thing. The music is a highlight; instantly charming, simple enough to stay out of the front of your mind, thoughtfully produced and arranged in such a way that the dynamic mixing pulls you deeper into the zone when you're having a good run, and manages to remain pleasant when you're not.  The game design choices are very thoughtful: The core movement mechanic of Poosh is so iconically simple, you can't help but think that maybe you've seen it somewhere before, so it manages to feel both fresh and timeless. Displaying friends' high score lines in Survival offers a nice dopamine kick when you pass them. The game succeeds in being addictive -- each run is only one life, and given the chaotic nature of the gameplay and the progressive difficulty curve of the procedurally-generated levels, runs are inevitably short enough that it's easy to say ""just one more"" ... and realize that you've been playing ""just one more"" for <whatever your definition of 'a long time' is>.  See you on the leaderboards!",1
138031395,2055910,"Excellent on Steam Deck. Deceptively simple, addicting and tantalizingly frustrating. It's a game you can definitely squeeze in when you have a minute here or there. But you also get lost in it and lose track of time. It's just so darn easy to hit that ""retry"". Poosh XL is calming and meditative while also being stressful and anxiety-inducing. Yes, I know that doesn't make sense. But once you play you'll understand. The music is a delight (well-done ""veryhandsomebilly"" Billy Mills), and the graphics are streamlined and attractive with a nostalgic feel. This is a game where the low price does not reflect the quality. Love that this developer keeps it more accessible. Highly recommend.",1

138032231,1940340,"I have almost 300hrs clocked in on the EGS side for when it was in early access. The game has come a very long way from when it first released, and its been improved upon immensely.   Fans from the first one will find a very different game here. For me, I much prefer this one to its predecessor. Instead of a long campaign, you get session based ""acts"", or ""confessions"". These can take any where from 2-4hrs depending on how long you take, routes you go, and other various factors.   I won't go in-depth on details of the game or differences from the first one, as I'm sure many have already stated in length. Instead, I will simply recommend this amazing, beautiful, and at times frustrating game.",1
138032133,1940340,no lo merecemos,1
138032109,1940340,"(Played the Epic early access version for 100 hrs or so) I bet this will be a polarizing title for fans of the first game, but I'm probably the perfect audience for it... I loved the aesthetic of DD1 but never got good enough to enjoy it, and I'm obsessed with Slay the Spire. DD2 basically puts DD aesthetics and tactical battles in a Slay the Spire wrapper, and it's fantastic. Good enough that I went back to DD1 and finally got good at that one too. The character backstories are well done, and the emphasis on relationships gives things a different feel. If you've ever gone on a long, terrible road trip, you'll appreciate the humor. The biggest difference is a less stressful atmosphere (for the player): You never get those desperate moments where you're afraid you'll lose a character you've spent hours building up and improving. You always lose all your characters, and they're always waiting for you at the crossroads on your next run. This worked for me, but others may feel like something's missing. But give this one a few runs before you give up on it. Like the first game, it really opens up and changes as you get new characters, abilities and trinkets, and eventually the tough victories become incredibly satisfying. 9/10 for me.",1
138031990,1940340,"I don't understand the backlash I've been seeing about this game. It's a breath of fresh air from the first one and I'm glad its not a carbon copy with updated graphics. The new models for the characters are fantastic and the game play revolving around a rogue-lite experience is enjoyable.   I find it similar to Hades with a form of guaranteed progression but still allowing for the threat of losing progress if your team wipes while on a mission. It's less punishing, in my opinion, and in turn - is more enjoyable.   I don't think this game is comparable to the first and anyone who does compare it, I think, needs to think about it in a different way.",1
138031979,1940340,"I bought this game on Epic the day it was released in Early Access, and have 96 hours in it. I'm a huge fan of the first game, and I couldn't have asked for a better sequel. The art style was what initially drew me to the original, and they translated it to 3D perfectly here; seeing a character drag their weapon across the ground with sparks flying still does it for me every time! The sequel takes us away from the hamlet and reveals a world in a downward spiral following the events of the first game.  Red Hook is the gold standard for how to do Early Access. They first released it 18 months ago, and even on Day 1 I was totally blown away. Since then, they've consistently added features and improved the gameplay. You could leave feedback at any time with a single keystroke! And, now that 1.0 is out, I know they'll continue to do so, including full mod support, just like they did for the first game. Red Hook cares about its community and it really shows.  As for the gameplay, the core turn-based battles are still there, but they've gone to a token system, which makes it more clear what your and your enemies' buffs and debuffs are, and how long they'll last. The arc of the game is a lot less grindy; you'll assemble a single team to take through a campaign of two or three hours, divided into legs of similar length to a single dungeon in the first game.  I feel more connected to the characters in this game, as there is only one character of each class. You stick with them for a longer haul, and if you lose them, they're gone for the remainder of that confession. They've put a lot of effort into the hero backstories as well; each hero has five chapters to their story, including several combat scenarios unique to them. The younger versions of the heroes shown in these scenarios will eventually be playable in the rest of the game, which I'm really looking forward to!  As before, the dialogue is out of this world, and would make H.P. Lovecraft proud. Wayne June is possibly the greatest narrator in gaming. Stuart Chatwood returns with another awesome soundtrack.  I love this game and Red Hook so much, I bought an extra copy just to support them and be able to leave this review!",1

It is not perfect but it's flaws for an early access small developer game are few. I will say the campaign took me about 3 hours to beat on Standard the first time around so if that's all your coming for you might want to wait for a sale. However there is replay value in unlocking new characters and abilities and leveling up the main character and I find it's worth it.   The roguelite gameplay is a lot of fun and each run is a good time. At this point the only thing I want to ask for is the ability to customize your player/team a bit more(maybe I haven't found it yet). Other than that it's great.

138033222,1366850,"The game is fun for what it is, a lot of p2p games deliver much less than this one, so I don't understand other people's expectations all too well. Its a crazy race with ejects, jetpacks, something like grappling hooks to chase up other players and you can also rack up extra points for air time, backflips etc. - Remember, its early access, so there is zero to none progression, but you can hop it and get some mindless fun for a couple of rounds.",1
138032813,1649130,"Heed the multiple warnings; If you don't have or don't intend to use a controller, be prepared for a genuine chore to manipulate this game. Keyboard control without rebinding is palpable at best, actively a hindrance at worst. Mouse support and key rebinds are planned, but as it stands at time of review, not available. Regardless of your method of control, however, this one is still a recommendation for me.  With that said, the core of the game is fun, if roguelites tickle your fancy. I believe it priced fair for the content provided, and encourage the developer to continue to improve on a very solid foundation. Progression seems well balanced, without (thus far, at least) a major ""tipping point"" of power balance.",1

If you've played any of his other games, it's very similar with the same feel and look as Ding Dong XL, and you probably should just go ahead and get it!   If you haven't, it feels like many classic arcade games: easy to learn, hard to master. And you only need one button to travel through the stages and obstacles.   And I gotta give props to my dude Very Handsome Billy for his dope vaporwave music!   Also, when you quit the game for the first time (I know, you won't want to, but you'll have to pesky things like eat, work, sleep, etc.), you'll get a special message from Adam himself thanking you for playing and asking you to leave a review, like I'm doing right now! I love supporting independent developers like Adam, and there's many ways to help them out, even if you don't buy their games!

Driving is boring, there is nothing to it that really makes me exited. It is like watching very long uninteractive loading screen until you get to next interesting thing. There is a lot of flavor thanks to environments and character interactions but it still seems like a long loading screen.   Non-combat events are very nice, I liked all of them so far.  Combat is on point, new tokens are much better then what we have in DD1. I was at death door multiple times but I always had options to keep avoiding death.  Biggest complaint is story fundamentals and driving. Other than that is seems like a very well made game.",0

Honestly, the negative critiques are fair in a way, but also not. The game is advertised as a sequel, but it's really a completely new rendition within the same IP. This isn't Darkest Dungeon 2.0, it's Darkest Dungeon the Spinoff. Their critiques are mainly a critique on the direction it's taken itself to, and their preference to the previous direction it had fit itself inside. And that's fair. It's fair to prefer the previous vision of darkest dungeon. It's not as fair to claim that bias as an objective opinion.",1

138034353,2272420,"I love thief simulator. Coming from someone with almost 50 total hours of playtime in the first game, I am really excited for what this game is going to be like. They fixed a lot of messy bugs in the first one, and I didn't really encounter anything game-breaking in my 2 hours of playing. That's not a lot, but its a pretty short prologue- and I remember hitting crashes and stuttering in the first game on the very first mission; something that isn't a problem for me at all so far.  A few things I noticed that could be fixed:  The jump is almost entirely useless. You could cheese a few places by jumping on the car in the first game, so I think that's why they toned it down, but your guy barely leaves the ground now when you hit space, man has a 2 inch vertical.  Some UI things show the wrong button. I changed a few keybinds, and the UI doesn't update with tutorials. Also, in the phone, it shows a picture of LMB to go back, but the correct button is RMB. Nothing game breaking, but its a bit confusing for a few seconds.  Its a bit difficult to put big items in the car. For me, it was very finicky after I opened both doors to try and slide an old TV or a painting in, which is especially stressful when you have the police called and I am desperately trying to shove something in the backseat. I think the first game was a bit better with this, where you can just throw open the trunk and shove a few paintings inside. Definitely needs a bit of a touch up or some changes to the collision.   Overall, really excited for this game. You can tell this sequel is already a lot more polished than the original by far. The drone and different side-missions like assault or planting evidence is also much more fun than smashing some poor guy's plates over and over again. 8/10.",1
138035032,1651490,"Early access review: Yeah it's great! Want a Sims-ian experience without having to sell your organs to EA? Here it is.  All the basic systems are in but there's not much variety FOR NOW (one cooker, one TV, one bed, one skirt, few hairstyles, etc.) but the foundations are clearly in place for that to happen (two computers, one cheap with reduced efficiency, one less cheap with full efficiency). Even so, there's plenty there to make some fun and interesting houses out of.  Dying/lifespans are in but optional. Even my worst cooks and tinkerers haven't caused a fire yet. Native linux support, hell yeah. Some nice accessibility and tiny customization options. Good selection of lgbtqia+ options and decorations too.  Mods and workshop integration already exist which is amazing. Sadly it seems like even the simplest ones that could be a few pngs and some json require a binary plugin to load them, which needs a C# development environment, so I've not tried yet.  Overall: Nice, looking forward to seeing where things go from here.",1
138034799,1566200,Best hockey game on steam for sure only few negatives i have is really no skill moves not being able to do a diving block and not being able to use the stick to deek and shoot but other than that alot of fun.

UI Is clear, all the environments are fun and original ! ❤️ Some points where I could see improvements would be :  - Level design is good, but when you push the other players in Holes, (and not portals) you don't get any point soo it can be frustrating to fight someone and see him fall and just repop (I don't know if he loses points or not). - Items are cool, maybe there is too few at the moment. - Core mechanics are interesting, maybe the game feel could be a bit more satisfying - The ability to create a private lobby might be a must have. :)  Overall, I see a lot of potential on this game and I hope there will be more players and engagement during the early access.",1
138035515,1649130,"I had some fun but the game needs much more work so i can't recommand it at this stage.  PROS: Roguelike where you keep items over runs is sweet. You end up not upgrading much between rounds though. Combats are fun too with auto ranged. I like game where you can grind and in this one you got it good with both skills and cosmetics to unlock.   CONS: I don't think that there is more than just one atmosphere which is repetitive. It doesn't seem like rooms are randomly generated but just picked out of a couple dozen, so it gets even more repetitive.  The camera is a pain! you run into walks and dont see the action or you need to move with your character very far to see if you didn't miss something at the beginning. It needs some work.  Also, many ratios on the gameplay need to be tweaked for having some fun: some costs of upgrades are too expensive compared to what they bring. Maybe if we could sell those scrolls we dont want we'd be able to afford some of them with a second specific currency ?  Also, i did not really enjoy the abondance of traps (which is mostly the same trap but when you need to loot an item on it ...), the fact that ennemy damage you when they spawn near you, the lack of regen (when you double your HP and miss one, then you stay at the same amount of HP not proportionnaly)   finally, I met some bug pretty fast, among which: - critical % bonus won't work - life per kill won't trigger on every kill - i got stuck by jumping on the chest in the lobby (character laid down and wouldnt move) - monster and boss can be cheesed by having them getting  stuck on props, they try to go straight and can't but you can range them. - when too close to an item it won't be selectable for equip/salvage  Good luck with development and i hope that i won't consider it overpriced next time i look at it.",0

138034966,1742020,"Hi. This is a mashup of a bunch of things. The sprites will make it feel like MBAACC. The ABC+Special will make it feel like Melty Blood(with EX-moves on C) or BlazBlue(Special = Drive button). There're cancels, there's burst, there's a lot here that can add plenty of depth.  The lobbies work, the rollback works, it's actually ridiculous how good the netcode is even across continents and oceans.  Quite frankly, this is an unexpected amount of polish for a fan game. It's worth playing. I would like to see it grow and develop and have the other few characters join in on the fun. This isn't just a fun game for Hololive fans, it's absolutely worth it for anyone who likes fighting games. Yeah, it won't be the next Strive, but it'll be worthwhile time spent with friends.   It's good. It's free. Give it a go. Pick one of your fighting game or non-fighting game friends and drag 'em into a fun-filled set.",1

Art is fantastic and the mole rats have so much personality! I really enjoy the puzzle elements aswell, the first few were a bit easy, but still enjoyable.

138035472,1940340,"Well, the release I counted down for is here and now I'm getting a refund after 15 minutes of play and forgetting this iteration exists.  The intro generates no excitement.  Aside from the signature art style and original narrator, there is nothing of interest.  We're given a ball of fire from the palms of a skinny guy while people everywhere are setting things on fire, everywhere.  I spotted a villager seemingly stabbing their self in the neck while funny at first, now appears more prophetic of the immense disappointment to come.  100% of the music from intro to first battle is noticeably MIDI and deeply lacks character; mostly just an oscillating warble meant to mimic a violin.  The massive tooltips cover relevant battle positioning menu information.. All the buttons are unnecessarily enormous while the information in all tooltips require that you know what the icons mean-- ""If you are [blue square], then [green waterfall] is 25% and [yellow crescent] is -10%"".  Quite astounding oversights given that this game was in Early access for something like two years and DD1 had already done it better.   Despite a vast amount of UI element flourishes to help navigate the screen, surprisingly little is clear without combing through the glossary for nearly everything and the story is simply ""world is chaotic bro"".  The main characters appear to be the biggest thing in this world.  Practically gods themselves.  The start of the game honestly feels like we're already at the end of the game.  Compare this to the first game which gives a taste of the action via two small-stature adventurers who've just crashed their coach along a treacherous road.  They have to fight to even get to the starting point of a more horrific destination that proves to be more treacherous than anyone could expect.  We are there with them stepping into this world of terror.  The starting battle absolutely ignited intrigue in the game and its world on first play.  After that first battle, you simply want more.  DD2 starts out with superhumans/demi-gods who are on the way to... I dunno, pick up the milk in Seattle?  The character classes I've grown to love in DD1, feel impersonal and out of reach in DD2.  I'm not even interested in them.  This may be the DD world, but it certainly isn't the DD experience.  First game is a masterpiece.  I don't even know what this one is and I don't plan to pay or spend the time find out.  I didn't even give it a thought that I might not like DD2's gameplay, I was simply kinda sad that this wouldn't be 2D or moddable.  However, I can't even bring myself to get through the tutorial stage.  I'm simply not interested in playing this game.  I wish Red Hook all the success in the world for creating such a first great game and congratulate them on completing their newest.  The thoughtful negative reviews though confirm much of what I suspected on my own from my meagre 15 minutes of play.    A dizzying fall.",0

138035109,1940340,"The first Darkest Dungeon was a formative artistic experience for me when I booted it up back in 2017. I was first getting into Steam gaming around that time, making my first few forays into Steam's elaborate and wonderful indie scene, when I stumbled upon the gorgeous beauty of Darkest Dungeon. The brilliant art style, which perfectly captured the macabre in approachable caricatures, first drew me in, but I stayed upon seeing the immaculate game design and enticing intrinsic narrative prompted by the events that went on in your specific estate. While certainly not a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination--one could talk for hours about its poor balancing, and frankly some aspects of its design that were downright unfair--it was a charming experience, and perfectly pictured to a starting indie gamer how indie games could find strength within brutal, unflinching difficulty, designed to be conquered by careful study and countless failures.  Having punched in 8 hours into Darkest Dungeon 2 on launch day, it's safe to say that Red Hook carries the torch of its franchise well. While a far departure from the escapades of the savage and downtrodden on a shabby hamlet, the combat has been fine-tuned into something truly enthralling, while the story and the artistic design have only been developed into further heights.  Looking back on it all, Darkest Dungeon has identified a vast majority of the artistic sensibilities that I've taken into my preferences of art and my own writing. I was worried, picking up the sequel, that the artistic beauty I glimpsed within the ravenous, clutching shadows of the Darkest Dungeon would be lost as the years have gone by. It's all still there: the grim-dark, historically vague world, the silly proportioned characters, and most of all, the crushing dread of defeat that follows the tantalizing rise of overconfidence. Darkest Dungeon 2 does not betray its audience with its new direction. In fact, I only love it more.  Thank you, Red Hook, for inspiring many young minds and continuing to inspire many more. We've been happy to inherit The Flame.",1

138036730,1566200,"This is a great idea, but poorly executed so far though. The actual hockey game play is sluggish and inconsistent. I used to play a lot of NHL 94, and this is a far-cry from the feel of that. The passing and shooting feel really off. The defending is non-existent. Switching characters feels bad, and when you get a defender skating backwards, it takes forever to feel like you've 'taken control'. Checking was the only aspect that felt semi-decent.  I love rogue games, but this one is poorly implemented. There is an artificial suck to your player starting out that can only be overcome with grinding rubbers. The skills were more of a hindrance most of the time than a help (throw stick at players, but now my char doesn't have a stick. shoot puck at someones face, but now I don't have the puck). The path through act 1 and 2 were the same each time, so no run variance really.   If the dev can get the core hockey game play more polished and implement the rogue elements to a satisfactory degree, then this will be a compelling title. Unfortunately, it does not meet my fun criteria and I'll be getting refunded.",0

138037633,1940340,"Disclaimer: While the playing time on steam will say around 1 hour, the actual playtime would be around 50 hours if we count the EGS version. Maybe also a spoiler warning for people that have not ever played the game before. On top of that i have to choose whether or not i recommend the game, i would like to not do it because i feel like its right in the middle at the moment i will put it as not recomended (that way people will maybe actually read the whole thing) I will start this review by saying that i will try to not compare DD1 and DD2 and base my whole review on which one i prefer between the two since they are two different games and as such are not bound to be exactly the same. The thing i really like about this game: - The 3D graphics and art style look nice and the animations have been really well implemented, when i use a move i really feel the ""oomph"" of having hit the enemy of buffed an ally and the soundtrack is top notch. - Being a fan of Lovecraftian-like stories i like the story and the concept behind it even thou if you get stuck on a certain confession you will end up hearing the same lines over and over again and that can get boring after a while. - While previous to 1.0 this would have been a negative, namely the difficulty progression between confessions, due to the new implementation in this new version. Previously it felt like, apart from more and more enemies being ordained and thus having a different buff and the final boss, there was not much difference between the confessions and their difficulty. Now that there actual enemy and encounter changes based on the confession i feel like the game ramps up its difficulty more nicely than before. - I like the turn-based combat approach + being able to see the order of action and plan accordingly. On that i have a small gripe being that enemy with set-up moves getting two turns in sequence to set-up and execute is a bit BS in my opinion (yes exemplar prelude and fall) Things i don´t like as of this version: - The ""new"" nodes system is not something i enjoy, especially if coupled with the scouting chance. I feel like i have no agency and that the consequences of going in blind not because you didn´t prepare but due to a dice roll are really heavy. Example being 3 oblivion tears after the other with no chance to avoid them. - Upgrades being locked behind the candles system is also something i am not crazy about but i don´t really have a particular reason for it. - Party composition specific confessions. Granted this might be due to me not being good at the game (i never pretended to be), i find that the game forces the player to have a specific party composition for the confession boss and/or the trophy they plan to take without a lot of wiggle room. This is going to be the only time i compare DD2 to DD1 (sorry) but there you could take any party you wanted and make it work with any boss. - Having to find trinket each time and them being more or less random (certain trinket in certain areas + academic studies) leads to the possibility of not being able to plan around a certain build or use a really good trinket because you have the wrong path or composition for it (example highwayman melee trinket on a dead-eye path --> just wasted) Things i am neutral about: - The token system. It´s fine, it makes it so the player has a clean way of seeing what the situation is and what is going on. But maybe it takes away a big part of wondering what is going to happen (especially since hitting is, without debuff, guaranteed in this game. - Relationships System. Much better than before but i still don´t understand why i have to be forced to use a skill from a negative relationship but not from a positive one. I feel like you should have the choice and make a decision between positives and negatives of using a ""negative"" skill. Overall i feel like this is a good game that is going to miff a lot of people that will compare it to its predecessor due to the direction changes. I have given my pro and cons and am open to discussions about what i have said. I will end up with saying that at the moment i feel like the price is a bit too much and would recommend waiting for a sale to buy it but i might be biased since i have already bought it on EGS so spending 39 euros on top of what i did before is a bit too much for me at the moment. EDIT: To clarify: i find 39 euros to be too much not due to the game not being worth them but due to my personal situation at the moment + it´s is not the reason i don´t recommend the game, as i said in the beginning, it is right in the middle for me due to the pro and cons i listed.",0

138037488,1940340,"Look, i will be frank: this is a great roguelike game, eliminating the grind that exist in the previous game, and at the same time adding many new menus and mechanics.  But...  DD1, at its core, was about you getting atached to some heroes, and doing EVERYTHING to keep it alive (be it because you didnt want to grind more, or because you liked him). It was fun because you were on a thin line, needing to choose between helping your hero, or save resourses (+ its mechanics helped A LOT in creating a diversity of char. mods and other add ons).  So... my point is: you want a (practically) no grind, no consequence game? Go for it, it is, as i said before, a great game. Just...dont expect to get atached to a hero, cause, you can get atached to a class, but, at some point, you will see the class that you like die and be like: ""well, run lost...lets do it again :)"" and RELLY not give a shit that your hero DIED.  Sorry for the big rant, just...if you expect DD1 here, dont. Just, dont. Its a great, but not DD1, roguelike   game.",1

138038788,1940340,"Temporary positive review. Let's see if the novelty effect stand the trial of time.  Is this DD1? No. Is this as good as DD1? Don't think so, graphics aside (which are *very* good). Is this a good game? Yes. Yes. Yes. Is this value for money? Yes, get/finish DD1 first.  A few reviews with <2h on the clock are saying that you don't get to keep your heroes, but that's not true. You DO keep your heroes if you win the chapter, you just lose the trinkets. You just lose them if you abandon the expedition. Yes, they are taking your trinkets away but you are going to find so many once you upgrade the stagecoach and heroes a bit, or beat a boss.  The game FORCES you to beat the boss if you want to have an easy life afterwards ([spoiler] or even just requires you to beat one per run after chapter 1 [/spoiler]).",1
138038694,1940340,"I would not recommend buying this yet. I haven't been part of the early access, so everything hits me based on the impressions from the original game. You don't get a village as center of things but a stagecoach. This stageoach has to be run through maps which is slightly like dungeon, but there's only one directiion and my choices are left/middle/right. Not back. Not retreat. I couldn't find how to retreat from battle. I'd expect this to be possible in exchange for massive stress. No. You apparently gotta die. Or you close the game. The save function is excellent. Once you fire it back up, you're right  back in the battle you wanted to get rid of.  I am certain people thought deeply and long about those screens at the beginning, like Altar of Hope with a bunch of other options behind it. Like that huge list of all the shit I found and the corpses of the fallen heroes from earlier tries. How the everluving frick do I get to use sthis stuff again? Is this there just to taunt me? What are these map-titled areas behind it where I can dish out points or candles or whatver for shit that's not explained in maybe a tooltip but in a horrible handbook hidden in other otions that's instantly flooding you with so much useless information that it buries what your looking for. Ah hey, there are red dots for the sections you have not yet read. Like 200 of them. Once you accidently clicked on one at least the red dot is gone. I still don't know the answer to my question though. Ah well, whatever, there will be a forum or something: JOIN US ON DISCORD. Do I want to ""chat and hang out with people"". Certainly not. I want an answer to a question.   The Tutorials are horrible. The graphics are DD, which is nice. The narator is the same as in part one. It's pretty lame that if one Man-At -Arms dies he comes back with the same name. DD1 was better. I became attached to my longevity champions and was really annoyed when I lost them. I know that I only patly understand what's going on with these mechanics and that some pro early accesses probably could point out the deep logic in their design and how I am just to dumb of a person to understand it. I'd expect roguelike frustration coming from other issues than flawed and muddled design choices.",0

138039141,1622800,"Really fun game, You can make absolutely gigantic labyrinth dungeons or tiny 1 room challenges if you'd like. For the cost It's a steal since you can easily get lost for hours making dungeons. I play with an xbox one controller and building is nice even on controller. Just Playing levels is fun, the game lets you play random levels after you've cleared one so in a way it's kind of like endless mode with no lives so you kind of have to make your own challenges but the random levels after you clear means you can go until you lose as a challenge. Some of the Dungeons the players have made so far are absolutely amazing so If you're mainly a player and only looking to play dungeons rather than make them well there's plenty of great levels being made for you. I definitely recommend this game for those that enjoy a little puzzle challenge but If you're not into puzzles it might be wise to avoid this since large amounts of the dungeons have puzzles and some can take awhile with lots of thinking. Aesthetically the game looks great, sound design is a bit lacking. The music isn't gonna blow you away or anything and there's not much you can do as a level maker to ease the dreary dullness of the same sound effects, You're gonna need to listen to your own music after awhile. At the moment enemies are not themed by the dungeon you do so those plant monsters from the jungle are also going to be in dark fortresses. I'm sure we'll get more enemy types eventually since we're missing tons of bosses and enemies so no problem. Ultimately this game does what Nintendidnt.",1

138040583,1566200,"Really, really great.  The moment to moment hockey feels good.  It feels alive and not on rails.  Don't let the 2D characters confuse you, the game feels way more 3D than screenshots or videos show.  I don't see why everyone is complaining about the lack of poke check button when the game auto poke checks when you are near an opponent.  What is the use of adding an extra button press?  Here are a few concerns I hope can be addressed in the future: -Inconsistent goal-tending, with goalies allowing shots behind their backs really often.  You'll eventually reach a team like the Mountaineers that just skate into the corner and shoot it at an 85 degree angle and it goes in every time.  There's nothing you can do as a player to defend against that. -Behaviors/strategies locked behind talents.  Really don't like having to draw a random talent to have my defensemen actually play defense, or my center to screen the goal. -Meta progression doesn't have an option to upgrade ""benchwarmers"".  Sometimes you get a terrible draw with them and it just feels bad to play. -Random events/gifts seem to have just as many negative effects as positive effects.  It is never worth it to visit a random encounter on the off chance it ruins your star. -Training seems to be too random, I've gotten runs where every training was +8 checking and my players never developed. -The game doesn't allow you to skip all of the animations and screen transitions.  In a game like this you need a quick turnaround and be able to get into the actual hockey as soon as possible, but I'm constantly stuck watching screen transitions and little cutscenes that start to get really annoying after a while. -No consistent way to choose which player you switch to on defense.  It seems to be based on proximity to the puck and frequently leads to confusion as you have no idea what player you're currently controlling if it switched more than half a screen away.",1

If u play as a marine running around the map first 15/20 mins is pretty wasted time. as long as u dont get some tank or something u can drive u dont do that much dmg.

138039944,1494420,"While it is in early access Silica is what it says on the box – RTS/FPS hybrid. What it doesn’t say is how gorgeous it looks, from the shimmering haze over the desert flats, to the shear scale of the maps I often found myself just looking around at the bleak rock-strewn expanse before me.  First up, the intro to the game was stylistically a great choice, the transitioning ‘oil painted’ images and narration really brought me up to speed with the universe and the conflict overall, so top marks there.  The DNA of Command and Conquer, StarCraft, Halo, Dune and Starship Troopers is very apparent, in the best possible way, and pretty much is my ideal blend of RTS combined with the Halo experience at ground level. At this stage the closest comparison to the RTS/FPS feel would be Battlefield 2142 titan mode, sans the soldier loadouts, respawning vehicles, tickets, titans, and capture points.  While the RTS plays a lot more like Command and Conquer – however with a lack of command fidelity (at this stage, no guard, attack move, waypoints etc.) One thing to note is that in RTS mode (also called command mode) the scale is so large that individual units are represented by unit icons, and when in proximity a number indicates quantities.  Two of the three factions (Sol and Alien) are fully realized, with the third faction the Centari present but mirror Sol and are scheduled for later development. The Sol units and weapons are completely believable, from the look of the individual vehicles through the design of the different troopers and their weapons, while the Aliens are pure nightmare fuel and the sum of their parts working together is fearsome – particularly as the heat of the day night cycle turns dark…  It is surprisingly functional for an early access game, with the RTS/FPS mode being the most polished, and the prospector (single/group FPS PVE) still under development, and the Arena FPS shooter mode. For a game developed by a single person (with support from BIS Incubator) I am really enjoying the game as it exists now, and I am not blind to the issues, errors and shortfalls (my list of suggestions grows with every match), but the genetics of a very enjoyable game is evident, and I look forward to watching the continued development.",1

A small list of things that bugged me that added up to me not wanting to play this  I do have high hopes for this game but just not gonna be bothering for now.  The main thing i'd love to see changed is a way of making player humans become more important. Maby restricting usage of heavy vehicle to players only. Right now the AI other then path finding are just better. Maby making maps way smaller would be better overall. A large map does not feel large if its just a giant sandbox. It just makes you feel slow.  [list] [*] The maps are very large, this makes traversing with any non fast vehicle an absolute nightmare. Teleports for marines slightly help with this but not much [*] When a large force starts fighting, you practically cannot see anything and may lag. Meaning AI is almost superior to humans in larger battles [*] (for me atleast) commander UI seems to just break, not showing various build options. Letting the AI commander take over to do stuff may help unlock some stuff but very annoying you cant do anything. [*] Many comments point out balance and I can agree to that, seems marines are very powerful [*] Harvester AI path finding being bad means they can often just get stuck on bad terrain [*] You cannot signal a harvester to stop so taking manual control when it does get stuck is nearly impossible due to having to climb the ladder to get in(which wont open while its moving) [*] Seems everyone just uses all chat? I want to say teamchat doesn't exist but I almost cant believe that to be the case and will assume I just didn't find it [*] AI have near perfect aim and are not obscured by the clutter of a large map, effects like smoke and explosions obscuring vision etc etc meaning AI is almost always superior for fighting then the players could be especially in larger battels. witch is a shame.

138040722,1940340,"Plague Doctor gets a negative Quirk which causes her to charge forward to Position 1 in the beginning of the battle.  Well no problem, I will just use her melee skill while waiting for the Highwayman or Man-at-Arms turn to use their Forward skills... oh wait, the Grave Robber will get stressed if the melee skill is used due to them being in a bad relationship.  Ok then, I will just swap places with the Man-at-Arms during her turn and use the Highwayman Forward skill to move her back to Position 3... then the Man-at-Arms smacks the Highwayman for 3 damage when he used the Forward skill because they are in a bad relationship too.  Repeat this pattern for a few fights, and my run is ruined.  Once you get a bad combo of Quirks and negative relationships which are beyond your control, you might as well restart your run and grind until you unlock items or skills to minimize these issues.  Buy only if you are a masochist or wait until the relationship balance is fixed.",0
138040709,1940340,"Be warned: this is NOT just a fresh coat of paint on our classic Darkest Dungeon. They re-imagined this game in a way that keeps the tone and essence of the gameplay while allowing its sequel to fit in its very own niche and not overshadow the first game. After playing this game, I will still definitely go back and play the first sometimes, but this new one is really great if you like this type of game.  Compared to the first one, it is much less 'large-scale' management. You do not have a huge roster of characters that you manage and swap around in between dungeons. Instead, it goes for the classic roguelike structure, where you pick a team and do a single run until you die with that team. Personally, I really enjoy this as it lets you worry a bit less about the outcome each time and progress is a little more tangible. Since they chose to go this way with the game, you now also get unlocks that follow you through runs, so if a run ends in failure you aren't just starting from scratch.  I think they added a lot of depth to the combat and I love the new team relationships system. It feels really rewarding to have a team member debuff an enemy, follow up with another team member for massive damage, and then see those two characters bond over their teamwork. It's such a small thing but it makes it feel very real.  As for the carriage, I think it is cool but the stretches of road are very long between POIs. I am still rather early in the game so this might change but there is a lot of downtime between locations while the carriage rolls along.  I think both games are going to have their place, and I do not think all fans of the first game will like this game. If you are a fan of roguelikes, you really can't go wrong with this though.",1

138040789,1494420,"I would recommend this games as it has so much potential and it's just getting started.  There are obviously bugs in the game... not the alien kind.  The Good:- 1) Great theme. 2) Interesting fights due to caverns/canyons and build sprawling desert plains 3) Vehicle play is fun 4) Good range of vehicle types, and no hard rock paper scissors.  Bugs/issues include:- 1) Harvesters getting stuck on anything that isn't flat... 2) Harvesters getting stuck trying to enter the refinery. 3) Ordering in Strat mode to attack causes your units to approach to point blank. 4) AI infantry shoot you from a million miles away, they rarely hit. 5) Aliens are too easy to wipe out with a car rush due to their lack of ranged early game and slow speed melee units. 6) Infantry need transports (I've heard that this is coming), please make it so not all die if transport pops en-route... 7) Left clicking on radar map (bottom left) whilst having units selected, so that you can pan your map there whilst having units selected... causes you to deselect those units. 8) Harvester speed feels so slow... especially with issues like described in 1+2. 9) AI behaviour in strat mode (commander) feels like it just sends units on patrol rather than building any effective force.  Requested features:- 1) Vehicle customisation - changing or upgrading weapon from default... maybe ammo upgrade for better penetration in exchange for slower ROF for player vehicles. (Using player requisition points to purchase). 2) Player ordered vehicles, that could be delivered to the front should yours get destroyed, obviously making it destructible as it is being delivered... 3) Commander abilities, Radar ping, supply drop, vehicle drop. 4) Grenades and infantry sidearm (either pistol or PDW). 5) Building range indicator 6) Transports and APC's... 7) Air vehicles",1

138042907,1940340,"A worthy successor to darkest dungeon 1, and one crafted in a deliberately different fashion in order to not obsolete the first game, as a result leaving both games distinct from one another and both with their own aspects that could improve upon or dimish the original darkest dungeon experience depending on who you are.  In my personal opinion I prefer the second game. It streamlines many aspects of the game by cutting down on grind, improving combat to be more tactical and while I enjoyed the art direction of the first game, this one can be downright jaw-dropping.  In particular I find there is more depth to this game's combat and I also enjoy the themes of the game's story more, so my personal recommendation over these two great games is the second one. (Especially for newcomers to the two games, I think darkest dungeon 2 will be easier to get into.)  Overall an incredible game and a huge congratulations to everyone at red hook for this accomplishment, and It will only improve more as time goes on and the game is updated more as darkest dungeon 1 was.",1
138042873,1940340,"It feels like they took Darkest Dungeons, removed everything that made that game unique in its class, and pushed out a generic roguelite where nothing really matters in the long run besides you getting the cross-run currency to make your guys only marginally better.  There's also no dungeons in darkest dungeons 2.",0
138042854,1940340,"The first thing you need to know about Darkest Dungeon 2 is that it's NOT its predecessor. While the tactical turn-based combat and unique atmosphere are still there, the structure of the game is entirely different. You will not crawl through any dungeons. You will not permanently lose heroes. You will not spend tens of hours grinding for resources and experience. And, I promise you if you approach with an open mind, chances are high you will not miss any of that.  [b][Core gameplay loop][/b] The theme of Darkest Dungeon 2 is that of a grueling journey through a bleak world on the brink of collapse. You build a team of four heroes and drive your stagecoach through up to 3 regions composed of nodes connected by branching paths until you either reach the Mountain, give up or die. You will die a lot. The game is very challenging, but fair. When you die it's because you made a mistake and through repeated failure you learn and improve, making for an unforgettably gratifying feeling when you finally master it. The further you get on your journey, the more candles you are awarded with. Flame is synonymous with hope in Darkest Dungeon and candles are valuable currency you can spend at the Altar of Hope to unlock a variety of upgrades that help you on all your future runs.   As your heroes travel and fight side by side, they develop an affinity for each other depending on the choices you make and the stress your heroes suffer during combat. This affinity then culminates in positive or negative relationships which affect the efficacy of your team for one region. Your stagecoach needs to be maintained, the Flame must be kept alive and bright, your heroes need to be healthy both physically and mentally. The further you get in a region, the harder it will get not to fail on at least one front, which makes long-term planning as vital to your success as the combat tactics you employ. After each region awaits a stop at the inn, allowing you to catch a breather and prepare for the next one or collect your spoils and retire.  [b][Combat and gameplay variety][/b] The tactical turn-based combat is fast, fluid and very satisfying. Compared to DD1 it's a lot more deterministic with fewer rng elements and it gives you a lot of agency and room for meaningful decision-making. If your big hit has a chance to miss because your character is Blinded, you may remove the negative token with a consumable item to guarantee a hit, use a non-offensive skill and let an ally cure you later, or risk it and attack anyway.   On the whole the gameplay is complex with lots of little things factoring into your success. Every choice you make has impact and sometimes its effects may reverberate even hours later in subtle ways. The character building in this game is top notch. When I first discovered the full variety of heroes and their skills and subclasses, trinkets and combat items, inn items, quirks, diseases, altar upgrades, memories, stagecoach upgrades and pets, I felt like a poor and starving university student who just came upon a giant free street-food market. My mind was racing with all the possible synergies. The game is reasonably well balanced (though not without some problems), the sheer amount of combinations is tremendous and the vast majority of them are perfectly viable. Enemies are creative and your ability to adapt is always rewarded. Itemization is fantastic, most equipment changes the way a character plays rather than just providing flat buffs and the game cleverly discourages hoarding consumables.  I must also mention how quick and smooth the game feels. Turn-based games often suffer from pacing problems and everything takes forever, but DD2 has never felt like a slog to me. Repetition inevitably sets in after some time as there are only so many regions and enemies in the game, but with the sheer amount of things to experiment with you'll hardly notice. If you enjoy turn-based games or roguelites, this is a treat.  [b][Art, visuals and sound][/b] The presentation level of Darkest Dungeon 2 is out of this world. The art, animation and sound design team have done a stellar job. The character animations are a treat for the eyes, responsive, sharp, full of detail and care. I still catch myself browsing through a hero's skills only to see them gracefully transition between idles or appreciating how every creature on the brink of death changes pose to a battered, exhausted slouch. The soundtrack by Stuart Chatwood is one masterpiece after another, it would deserve its own review and I strongly encourage you to give it a listen and support him even if the game itself is not for you. Every moment you spend with the game will be narrated by the irreplaceable Wayne June. The sound effects are solid, the art style is consistent and beautifully executed, the world's biomes and inhabitants tell stories through their appearance and sound alone. All of this adds up to an immersive, memorable atmosphere that is simultaneously bleak and hopeful.  [b][Story][/b] The game is split into 5 acts known as Confessions following the story of the Academic (narrator) and his Protegé who were at the epicentre of the spreading calamity. Each hero also has a personal narrated backstory which, much like the main story, focuses on failure and regret. The emotions are magnified tenfold by the utterly brilliant narrator. In typical Darkest Dungeon fashion most of the story is told in short, narrated segments or via the environment and its inhabitants. Expect no dialogue or novel-like storytelling. Your heroes' situational barks, quirks and relationships as well as your choices make each journey its own self-contained little story.  [b][Technical state][/b] The devs have maintained a very high standard of quality even throughout Early Access. Nothing goes out that hasn't been tested and bugs have been very rare. Optimization could be a little better as people have on occasion complained about frame drops and poor performance, but you will likely only feel this if you barely meet the modest recommended specs.  [b][Amazing devs][/b] Early Access launch was met with lots of scepticism and poor reviews. I can say without exaggeration that what the people at RedHook have done with the game since then is a masterclass in developing an Early Access title, they listened thoroughly to player feedback and every change they made was absolutely spot on. This is a studio full of highly competent people who truly care about their game and respect your voice. With the amazing work they've done over the last year and a half I can't wait to see this game after another year or two of new content.  [b][Summary][/b] Darkest Dungeon 2 is an outstanding tactical rougelite rpg that stays true to the spirit of its predecessor while having its own distinct identity, with gameplay that can make anyone lose track of time, a metric ton of variety and replayability, beautiful art and an immersive atmosphere unlike any other game out there. Whether you're a fan of tactical rpgs, roguelites, DD1 or you simply stumbled upon this review by accident, I can only recommend you give this game a try.",1
138042549,1940340,"Went from a somewhat unique take on the genre to Slay the Spire knockoff #527 (or that space game, forget what it's called).

Absolutely, and if you already had Darkest Dungeon 1 you have a 25% discount. Do you recommend the game? Yes, it is very addicting.  Overall: MASTERPIECE.",1
138043188,2387950,"The framework is solid and there are lot of things that invite you to play. However, over-reliance on delivering old-school experience does more harm than good.   Your character begins in the main town, where you may find your first magic ability and a store where you can use the game's currency, copper, to buy stuff. Because there is not much else to see in the village, this shop is the main reason for coming back.   Some items significantly alter the game. The upgrades that don't cost much include things like glide, better attack, and double-jump. However, as this is not a metroidvania, you can also totally ignore them.   The hero is quite capable of handling everything with its sword and runes that are your standard elemental powers. Additionally, you may need to use them to create a path or destroy something. The issue is that runes need to be restored by collecting mana. Even though the game tries to address this by respawning everything every time you move screens, you typically run out just when you need it most.  Stages are visited from a map and completed in a linear order. All are filled with enemies and pits that want to make your life miserable. The hard difficulty might be too much for the first playthrough because enemies have more health and add a ranged attack to their arsenal. If you want to avoid situations where an enemy hits you right over a hole that causes you to fall in and die, go with normal.  Stages end with a boss fight. There's no strategy involved because good old button-mashing does a fine job. By the way, the entire stage can be beaten by just moving forward and attacking, especially with the new weapons you receive after beating a boss.   Since the game works on lives system, those insta-kill pits were a deal-breaker. Lives don't reset, so if you finish a stage with only one left, you'll have to be extra careful, search for lives around the stage, or buy it in a shop.  The game’s mechanics do not make the experience any easier. You also need to worry about hooks you can grab onto, underwater parts with air bubbles, and wider pits that can only be crossed by building your attack power and turning your sword into a pogo stick.",0

138044696,1742020,"Good free to play 2D fighter but holy this game can be pretty broken. Long term I don't expect much in terms of balance because I have no idea what each character is trying to achieve, but  this feels more of a turn your brain off kind of fighting game (that isn't DNF-Duel, thank god), and not a GG or UNIS kind of game. Sure game lacks polish, but for a free game it makes you wonder why the heck you pre-ordered DNF (okay I'll stop lol).  Stuff I wanna criticize;  1. Training and tutorial needs a virtual joystick. It is very painful seeing non FGC players hopping in and not understanding how motion inputs work. A virtual joystick will very much help them visualize their inputs and not wonder why they keep jumping or doing crouch normals.  2. UI is unintuitive. I hope this is something that gets overhauled when online comes out of beta, but why is it that I have to wait for someone to join my room to be able to select my character, when I could have done that while waiting? It isn't like the system is in place to make sure players don't get a preferred matchup, since you can't even see the opponent's character until you're in-game.   That's pretty much all I have to say. Game is pretty, music is great for the setting and overall tone, but tutorial is kinda jank and a lot of Holo girls were confused from it, movement feels stiff, some moves and their inputs don't make sense (like 2H being a launcher while 3H is a sweep) etc. Definitely recommend if you're a Hololive fan, or an FGC fan looking for a decent free to play fighting game.",1

Which is sad, I feel like there is a good core idea, but as is more and more common it feels like it was put out when only about 25% done.  It all seems to work, but it simply isn't fin or interesting, and it had zero personality.  Perhaps a minor point, but I was also disappointed that it doesn't have a full screen option. The enemy units are gormless, I guess there is a difference between them, but whatever it is is lost on me.  The same is true for the towers. A bit of a problem as you are frantically trying to place them in such a way as to allow for merged upgrades, but you can't always tell them apart, in particular the red ones.  There seems to be only the one map, a big square, in which you try to create a path, but as you are also trying to create merging upgrades, your improvements rip apart the walls. To make matters worse, it is very easy to reach the point where you can't place any more units, and there is then nothing you can do but sit and wait to die, which is never any fun.  Two big thumbs down at this point. Who knows if they are still working on improving it, but to be honest, they should be ashamed of putting it out as is.",0

As someone who's played ALOT of the first game, it surprises me that the devs changed the core gameplay loop of the series to this as that previous loop facilitated alot of what made the first game so addictive and gripping.  Somehow, transitioning to a roguelike has made me less inclined to replay it.

Maybe not with the roster present but the methods of making it. I love the 2d style and feel that it feel cohesive in its artstyle throughout. However I think the campaign is okay enough, I do wish there was more of a congratulatory ending screen. Overall really good. I like it.",1

138047030,2216430,"EN: Muscle Giants is a weird and exhilarating experience. The game's description is pretty accurate so don't go expecting stuff that doesn't exist but, if you let your heart lead you, and choose this weird bald muscly filled game, I'm pretty sure you won't regret it.  The dev is probably a Cho Aniki series fan, and he has my utmost respect for that! If you love strange PSX-era experimental games, this might be right up your alley.  ----  IT: Muscle Giants è difficile da consigliare, soprattutto se non amate il nonsense tipicamente giapponese o produzioni sperimentali dell’epoca PlayStation. Ricorda in certi aspetti il filone inaugurato dal gioco Cho Aniki, uno spettacolare shoot ’em up per PC Engine di cui si presuppone lo sviluppatore sia un ammiratore. Tuttavia, se anche non rientrate in quella piccola cerchia di persone che trovano questi giochi esilaranti, vi consiglio di provarlo alla luce del prezzo non eccessivo.

138048093,2400740,"it was a short sweet mystery game :) i enjoyed it and i liked the music and art style, i think the story was a little vague, especially toward the end, but other than that it was good. 4/5",1
138047502,2055910,"Wonderful game, I'm absolutely terrible at it, it's the ultimate 'one more try' kind of game addiction. I love the colorful neon vibes and great music.",1
138048875,1940340,"I really like the first Darkest Dungeon but this one just feel worse in every way except for the graphics. I hate the carriage. I can not express how much it destroys my enjoyment of the game. I hate how the whole system is set up with the inn, the carriage and altar of hope. It just fells worse than the system they have in the first Darkest Dungeon with the hamlet. I was really looking forward to this game but after playing it, I just think it sucks. I'm not having fun. The biggest reason as to why I'm even leaving a negative review is so that Red Hook can see it. Here is hoping for something better in Darkest Dungeon 3 if they make it.",0
138048869,1940340,"Many are upset due to the differences from the first game which is completely understandable however I am enjoying this game so far as the short rogue-like format lines up better with my personal preferences, if you are also a fan of this genre and like the world of darkest dungeon then i wholeheartedly recommend DD2 for you. If you are looking for a game like the first then sadly this is not the game for you as red hook have taken the series in a different direction and made significant changes gameplay-wise as the game now consists of short runs with a single party of heroes rather than a long and arduous campaign spanning many hours in which you develop attachments to your heroes and can have a whole roster of many heroes with different abilities, quirks, trinkets, levels etc.",1
138048784,1940340,"Style still feels very nice and the animations feel butter smooth. Its a different approach to the game than dd1, being more like a roguelike; its fun as its own sort of reflavor of the original dd1",1
138048621,1940340,"Many franchises fall in the face of their sequels, but not this one. Not today.",1
138048588,1940340,"This isn't DD2. This is more like FTL: Darkest Dungeon, or Slay the Dungeon Spire.  Rather than choosing your 4-man party and exploring different dungeons, you're going from point A to B via different paths with random encounters. This is further split into different chapters, and if you fail, repeat from the start. You also don't keep most of the stuffs when you restart your expedition. Only permanent thing I noticed so far is additional hero's skills that you unlock during the run. Instead, they give you ""candles"" for achievement unlocked during each runs, which are used for unlocking more items, new heroes, heroes stats, cosmetics,   No more double Plague Doctor, or Quad-Jester ""Do you Bleed?!"" party.  Based on what I've seen so far, I definitely like DD1 better.. Enjoyable yes, but nothing new or exciting.   6/10.",0

138047569,1940340,"The gameplay is pretty much nothing like the original. Mostly for the better in my opinion – no longer do I need to fear for my veteran squad to die, setting me back dozens of hours. Instead, every expedition has merit. Even if it fails you get rewards that help you in the long run, scaled on how far you made it.   Gameplay aside, the atmosphere (which was my main draw for DD1) is still the same. Gloomy, dark and desperate - with the iconic narrator whispering sweet nothings in my ear the whole time.  I'm not so far in as to grasp the story all that much yet, but I like what I see so far.

138047504,1940340,"Well, it's Darkest Dungeon.  I bought the game when it came out in early access, and I bought it again today on day one on Steam, because the guys at Red Hook deserve all the support they can get. They dared to revamp the game formula and they were successful in doing so. DDI remains a very rare and precious pearl, enriched by the work of the modder. DDII has all the prerequisites for repeating the same success as the first, because it already has a very solid foundation, but I'm sure that with post-launch support (DLC and other contents) and with the future work of the modders, it will be able to shine as much as and more than the first. Welcome back to the Darkest Dungeon. ---------- Ho acquistato il gioco su EGS quando è uscito in early access, e l'ho ricomprato oggi al day one on Steam, perchè i ragazzi di Red Hook meritano tutto il supporto possibile. Hanno avuto il coraggio di rinnovare la formula del gioco e hanno avuto successo nel farlo. DDI rimane una perla rarissima e preziosa, arricchita dal lavoro del modder. DDII ha tutti i presupposti per ripetere lo stesso successo del primo, perchè ha già una solidissima base, ma sono sicuro che col supporto post lancio (DLC e altri contenuti) e col futuro lavoro dei modder, potrà brillare come e più del primo. Bentornati nel Darkest Dungeon.",1
138047379,1940340,Was a big fan of DD1. This one is utter bs though. Zero control about anything. Whoever had the idea with the stagecoach totally killed the game for me. Absolutely streamlined... The town from DD1 with all it's buildings is completely missing. Party is too small. Don't buy.,0
138047272,1940340,Does DD2 live up to the hype?  Absolutely not. Is it worth £33? Absolutely not.  Is DD1 better than DD2? Absolutely.,0
138047211,1940340,"This is one of those times where a neutral review would be really awesome. I am still recommending this game because I do think it is a good value for what it offers - but there are a few disappointments that need to be acknowledged at the same time. If these don't bother you, or you can overlook them - I think there is a great game here, but it is a very different game from the first game.  [b]A Few Favorables[/b] - Graphics and animation improvements. - Combat is exactly what you came for if you are returning from the previous game. - There is something nice that a run ends in a couple of hours instead of having to really monitor a larger campaign. Both a favorable and unfavorable depending on what you are here for. - The changes that do exist to the combat system I believe are favorable. It is simpler than the last system and not in a bad way.  [b]Meta Progression is Painful[/b] Very slow meta progression to unlock core features of the game. You start with only 4 heroes and have most of their skill options locked behind a wall of grind. There is a ton of meta-progression that is strictly power creep - which is typical of this genre, but not typical of old school Darkest Dungeon.  [b]No Broader Campaign Administration[/b] There really is very little character attachment in this game like there was in the former. There is some in that units can persist between runs - but it doesn't have the same tension or heart and soul that the original game evoked. The tension of losing units in the last game is part of what made the game so magical - this game doesn't trigger the same feelings.  [b]That Coach...[/b] The coach taking you from path-to-path doesn't feel great to me. This system is actually pretty good if you don't compare it to what we once had. . . but if you enjoyed the dungeon crawl that the first game offered you in a mission - this is going to feel worse by comparison.   I will say - I don't miss the curios at all though.  [b]Conclusion?[/b] Lukewarm - I am going to keep playing it because I am having fun in spite of some of the disappointments.",1
138047152,1940340,"- A new take on the DD experience that still holds mostly true to the first DD game with new takes or thrown out grinds. Was a fan of DD1, but couldn't bear with it and only completed it only once with it's intense roster/base grinding.  - DD2 has rouge like elements to it so completing a run will take maybe 2-3hrs compared to the 30-60hrs of DD1. - Lore is greatly improved and enjoyable with every character having a past you get to experience and play out with the their puzzles. - Biggest piece of advice for this game is the same as the first ""accept loses, mistakes, and failures""",1
138047146,1940340,"Excellent animations, art, gameplay",1
138047130,1940340,"Im not reccomending this game not because of:  [list] [*] The change in direction from DD1 [*] The rogue-lite aspects the game has now taken on [*] The lack of new classes/characters (As of now, only 1 new one) [*] Missing original game's classes/characters (As of now, [b]missing 7[/b]) [*] No more duplicate classes (RIP Point Blank Shot + Quad Leper meta) [*] The lack of Reynauld [*] The fairly confusing UI with annoying Tutorial reading manual style prompts [*] No more base building or hero investments [/list]  The true reason i am not recommending this game is simply on the basis that [i][b]it has been beta tested by epicgames players and we still dont have controller support[/b][/i]. I mean come on, get controller support in dammit. I mean, why the heck did they introduce [i]click and hold to confirm[/i] but no controller support???

138050135,2384850,"I've always been an avid fan of [i]Tonguc Bodur[/i]'s walking sims. I have fond memories of the [i]Drizzlepath[/i] and the [i]Nephise[/i] series that are perhaps his best works. Lately, I have had the opportunity to play some of his shorter sims such as [i]Loverowind[/i] or the [i]phile[/i] series. Then I found [i]Education[/i] an interesting step towards the horror genre and I took note of what a convoluted mess [i]Lucid Cycle[/i] was.  With [i]Bottle[/i] I am happy to confirm he has returned to his roots. Once again this is a great walking sim with the required amount of narrative, good music and with a gameplay that has an acceptable pace of walking (we can toggle running and there are orbs giving us boost regularly).  I understand this is a remake of the game with the same title from 2016, this time created in Unreal Engine 5. The game looks nice and runs smoothly apart from some micro-stuttering at the beginning. If I remember correctly the original [i]Bottle[/i] was somewhat longer, still, it was nice to play the revamped version.",1

While the game is now a rougelike, it still keeps that darkest dungeon style and feel to it, rocking insanely cool animations, environments and enemies.

Well, my 4 team party was defeated by one enemy after I finished the prologue. That enemy had 0HP and was being saved constantly by death doors... So each of my characters hit it which gives 4 hits, plus I applied blight status which gives extra 5th hit. Nothing. After that my entire, healthy party was wiped out by a single, standard mob. I found it really amusing of how unfair and ridiculous this is. WHY changing something which worked well in DD1 into some BS to make the game so ridiculously difficult?

138054453,1940340,"I've played DD like many here, for countless hours across all platforms. I absolutely love this sequel, to the point I'd say I enjoy it more than the first. I have way more than 3.5 hours in total from EGS by the way. Like all things, some will love or hate something. My only criticism is the performance isn't quite smooth on my system. I can run Red Dead Redemption 2 maxed out at 60 fps. This game during combat is smooth, but driving the buggy / carriage, whatever you wanna call it, has frequent dips for me anyways. This game has been in development for 2 years or so. I'm sure it will improve over time. Best thing to do, is watch lots of people play this game so you can see whether or not you enjoy how the game has changed. It's not a cheap indie game.",1

You can place buildings on a tile but each tile has some effect that will impact the other types of tiles around it , hence you must very carefully choose what tiles to place and where.

I haven't played enough to know if eventually you can become tethered when the train is moving.

125125085,2027560,It's not aweful but needs some finessing for sure. It kinda feels like a mobile game mostly at this point but it's fine.  Pros:  - Each level has multiple difficulties which is cool. - You level up all your characters at once - The upgrade system is pretty easy to use.  Cons: - The UI is not great - the art style and player sprites just don't mesh super well. - it gets pretty repetative quickly.  For being in EA I know it still has more to go and i think it'll be good but this one currently just skids into a thumbs up. I give  it 2/4 Valkyries.,1
124027904,2027560,"I really liked how the game looked and wanted to try it. I played it more than one hour straight without realizing, there's not in game tutorial so I was a bit lost the first minute but it didn't take long for me to get hook and wanting to see more!!!

123821893,2027560,"This game is less than a coffee and will last a lot longer!  I like that you can play single player or co-op multiplayer. Sometimes I just want to do my own thing and it brings that to the table.  The bloom and number pop-ups can be adjusted so don't worry too much about those. I was unsure of purchasing when seeing them in the preview but there is an option to change the screen activity!  Dying isn't the end of the world either. You do lose some progress but it's nothing that will make you rage quit. Full resets on death are sooo frustrating but not an issue here.  Overall it's a fun game and totally worth the money. I didn't realize I could get addicted to a game so quickly; if it weren't for work I'd probably still be playing. I suspect there's still some good improvements to come given this is still in EA, but don't wait, check it out now!",1

It's a bit difficult but at least not boring, the grind loop is then fun!  We didn't push the game very far yet, but we really liked what we see. It's hard to judge the depth that early in the early access and with not so much hours, but it's a great start!  The french translation is a plus!",1

123764026,2027560,"It's close to barebones atm ie ---------------------------------------  - very simple talent tree: atk%, atk speed%, speed%, exp%, etc  - With unbalanced stats to pump gems into. For example; you'll reach max lvl (20) loooong before you come anywhere near the end of getting through all the stages without spending any gems on exp%+ in the talent tree, so that twig is currently next to useless.  - items you buy with gold offer very to no nuance, almost all the time the more expensive one is better.  - Some slots don't have any items for sale yet.  - Each character has a form of an elemental attack (if I can believe what the skill icons say in the shop menu bcs visually it also leaves much to be desired), yet there is no elemental dmg or effects and one champ is clearly better then the other which makes all the older champs redundant  - no rebindable keys  - sound is sometimes still loud even on lowest volume. My guess is that hit reg sounds stack.   YET the grind loop is fun, and you can feel your character improving ones you bought an upgrade. For some pocketchange I would definitely recommend it towards fans of the genre.   My suggestions: ---------------------- - introduce conventional stats like: crit chance, crit dmg, ele dmg, ?ele crit chance?, projectile size, melee weapon swing size, weapon range, aoe size, etc  - more variety in power pick up. especially in chests (why would I need a hp pot?, the map is filled with them)  - introduce elemental dmg and make them meaningful and show it visually.    Meaningfull (in order of the champions currently in the game):    - Ice: slows, chance to freeze (frozen enemies take more dmg)   - Fire: does high instant dmg and small short dot dmg. Attacks have a chance to hit a close      by enemy   - Holy: offers heal in some kind of way (healing pool on the ground, chance to heal yourself      and teammates who are near, use your imagination)   - Dark/void/shadow whatever you want to call it: does long dot dmg but low instant dmg and      stacks, some kind of debuff towards the enemies (lower dmg, take more dmg, chance to      atk eachother, etc). This would make playing the game in multiplayer a lot more interesting and you could go nuts with the talent trees,items and *scaled* difficulty (-and in return also rewards-) example: Do I want to focus my frost champ on high dmg potential with freez chance or do i want to focus on aoe slows and increase slow amount with consistent average dmg?  - Far bigger and personalized talent trees for each hero   What somewhat differentiates this game from the rest in the genre is the talent tree system and items. So I would have fun with  those (as dev included) and this would shine through in the end product I'm 100% sure (the price could then easily be increased imo). Also unique is that it's stage based; I would put a lot more emphasis on difficulty and rewards for it.",1
138055408,1824960,"Fun game, pretty short though.",1
138055120,2311190,WWWWWWWWWSWWWW,1
138057768,1375900,"It's fun to try due to few unique mechanics, but has no replayability due to boring upgrades.  It has potential to be one of the unique gems, and only needs some creative upgrades (maybe a bit of weapon balancing) to get there. Based on what I've seen I full expect the devs to take this game to that place, but I never recommend games based on what they can be, so it's a ""no"" for now.  [h1]Gameplay[/h1] The 2 unique gimmicks of this game are  [list] [*] Mining to get to places. Walls also have eggs, which you'll dig and release enemies. [*] Fuel. You're running out fast and when you're out it drains health. You have to keep keep killing to survive. [/list] These 2 - gold.  They are simple, but they force a slightly different playstyle than most similar games.  [b]Upgrades[/b] Upgrades felt boring/uninspired. Vast majority of them are tiny boosts to damage (raw damage, fire rate), AoE, or HP, mobility and such. The 2 upgrades I can say were at least a little exciting were ricochet (bullet seeks secondary targets) and bullets having a chance to cause an explosion (valuable AoE + synergy with explosive damage). There were stronger ""special"" skills, which you get 1 of after upgrading 1 passive of a weapon, but those are just a bigger damage increase.  So for example, ricochet is pretty much mandatory on machine gun. An example it could go for to mix things up: [list] [*] 1 Ricochet (seeks 1 extra target), so guaranteed 2 enemies hit. This is already in game. [*] 2 Punchthrough (pierces 2 extra targets), up to 3 enemies hit, but only IF you line them up. Not in game. [*] Massive damage boost, enough to mitigate the need for AoE. Not in game. [/list]  [b]Weapons[/b] Weapons different on paper, but I feel like they are poorly balanced, which causes them to feel the same. Machine gun hits a single target fast, while blade is a huge AoE around you. They are both equally useful if upgrade and equally useless if not upgraded. A blade should be high risk, high reward and the risk just doesn't pay off. Mortars are effectively slow ranged AoEs, which given the random nature of aiming will rarely hit crowds reliably, which makes it about as useful as the other 2. Every weapon has a similar issue.  I'd look into giving each weapon an advantage that others don't have. At the moment only blade (melee range) sort of has one (needs tuning).  [b]Meta-progression[/b] Meta-progression is 100% flat stat boosts to basic stats. I was excited to see the other character, until I actually unlocked it and saw it's basically the same thing with a different starting weapon (which I already tried, because it's not exclusive) and SLIGHTLY different stats.  It has the framework for unlocking mutually exclusive upgrades, but at the moment all upgrades either have a clear winner, or make no difference whatever you pick. I'd say this is a good place to think on upgrades that actually impact playstyles (like a choice between movement speed*, dash and damage).  *Just an example. I'll get to movement speed.  [b]Classes[/b] They look different, they play identical. They have tiny differences in stats. The only noticeable difference is movement speed, which isn't worth as much in this game as it is in others.   Why not give classes unique skills, unique stats, access to different weapon pool or just unique perks to weapon? To give 1 example: 2nd class has blades as primary weapon. Why not make it a blades-only class, but have blades do 2 hits (1 on the target and 1 weaker somewhere around it)?   [h1]Movement speed[/h1] This stat is completely worthless in this game. In other games it allows you to run from enemies or maneuver between enemies. In this game walls have enemies, so if you rush in and you get destroyed and enemies always spawn close, so movement speed will usually not help. Also, opened areas slowly close, which means you usually have a small area to maneuver in.  The only ""advantage"" I noticed in movement speed is enemies slowly get faster and if you have none, they catch up. This felt like a cheap artificial difficulty wall more than an advantageous upgrade.  Given the nature of this game, I think movement speed should stay fixed (more or less) and maybe give access to limited boosts to specific classes or as a mutually exclusive upgrade in in meta-progression. It definitely doesn't work as a cumulative upgrade.",0
138056132,2346890,"[h1]🤔Overall Impressions🤔[/h1] [quote][h2][b]Bananaguy has lots of positive elements making this game very enjoyable in the main, but the wall jumping mechanic is a little frustrating which did mar the experience slightly.  Other than that, there is a lot of humour and charm running through the game, interesting characters to talk to, and some tricky platforming in places to perform. [/b][/h2][/quote]  [h1]🕹️Gameplay🕹️[/h1] [h1]🎬Gameplay Video🎬[/h1] https://youtu.be/8G0dwo6ZgMc  Bananaguy is after the ultimate prize, a golden banana which legend tells is hidden in a faraway land protected by many traps and puzzles.   There are three lands to explore, and in each land, you must collect enough tokens to progress in your journey. There are more tokens than you actually require, which is good because there are some tricky puzzles and platforming needed to get some of the tokens, but if you want to try and acquire all of them, then you are rewarded with an achievement for your efforts.  There is no map, so token locations are hidden, and exploration is needed to find them. Levels were reasonably big, and there are quite a lot of areas that aren’t that accessible, so I did struggle to find all of the tokens, but I managed to find enough to progress.  Along the way you are likely to bump into characters which you can speak to, challenging you to mini games, or sending you on small quests, with a token being the reward. It’s always worth talking to characters as they often have something witty to say, and the humour was silly, but usually very funny. It gave the game a very slapstick appeal which complimented the silly character designs, jovial music, and bright, colourful graphics. I was impressed with the number of characters you could interact with and the different tasks they provided. It made the journey feel like an adventure with platforming elements, rather than a plain platforming experience.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2973723938  Bananaguy has a signature move where he can slip out of his skin, projecting him forward at pace, perfect for jumping over large chasms or reaching higher ground. Sometimes, he can slip out of his skin, collect another skin, and slip out of that one, and these mechanics are present in the more trickier platforming sections.  Game play was actually quite varied with levels getting more difficult as you ventured on your quest.  My only gripe with the game is the wall jumping mechanics. I have played lots of games with wall jumping and I have never had any issues, but the wall jumping in this game feels frustrating, and it ruined my enjoyment on numerous occasions.   In most games you jump on the wall, and then jump again in the direction you want to go. Easy! In Bananaguy, you have to jump on the wall, press into the wall to make him bounce off the wall, and then quickly press in the opposite direction to reach the adjacent wall. What often happens is that because you press into the wall, Bananaguy jumps off, but then travels back to the wall you just jumped from, because you didn’t press the other direction quick enough. Walls are often close together, leaving you no time to react, and it proves to be very annoying.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2973729488  There is an achievement for completing the game in under twenty minutes, so speed runners might be interested in this game, but it took me two hours to complete, mainly due to the jumping mechanics, so good luck! Most of the achievements I would call quite challenging so there is a lot of extra game play if you want to tackle them.   [h1]🍳Conclusion🍳[/h1] [quote][h2][b] [i]Bananaguy[/i] is a charming platforming game which can be challenging in places, mainly due to the awful wall jumping mechanics, but the inclusion of mini games, quests, and interesting characters to meet, elevates game play and makes this an enjoyable experience.

138056036,1742020,"Honestly feels like I'm playing on MUGEN with some of the controls and character moves, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. (In fact, it got me back into playing The Black Heart again) I WILL mention (at least at the time of writing) that the AI in offline vs. seems WAY overtuned. I could not legitimately tell the difference in difficulty change from medium to easy; the AI was just kicking a** like it was on hard mode the whole time.  Virtual Frontier is AMAZING. The sheer amount of content it provides is nothing short of impressive, and is also chock-full of references to boot.  Overall a very solid launch in my honest opinion. Combat could use a few tweaks to feel more smooth and responsive. I feel perfect blocks could use a slight buff as well, since to me it doesn't feel like they're providing that significant of a boost for pulling them off. An idea in that regard would be to give a slight frame advantage as well, rewarding timing and enabling better counterattacks. (See Soulcalibur V's Just Guard mechanic for reference)  You guys should be proud of yourselves; you've got something rly good going on here, and the tireless effort you've all put into it shows.

138057323,2373540,"In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the *new*. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary game from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the game and its makers have challenged my preconceptions about fine game design is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core.  Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist *can* come from *anywhere*.

Personally, I'm not patient enough anymore to build up the ambition to be good at games like this, so I'll probably lose interest very quickly. I'd prefer a more relaxed version or mode that doesn't mean insta-death. But, anyone looking for a challenge in a game like this, will probably have fun. It's a cheap game anyway, so it's worth trying out.",1

138058833,1940340,"This game does not respect your time. A roguelite experience is repetitive and needs to be fun right out of the gate. You are expected to fail and restart a lot. Sadly, each start is filled with tedious tasks, and it takes a lot of time to get into any meaningful content. The upgrades you get between runs are not exciting and feel like they are just slowly fixing an artificially broken game. The initial experience was terrible. After 2 hours, I unlocked a single character, the berserker, who didn't even start with their signature ability. You've got to unlock that!   The carriage slows everything down without adding anything of real value. Giving death resistance to enemies makes combat unpredictable in a way that isn't interesting. The boss makes his saving throw three times in a row? I guess you just wasted a half hour. Oh, and now you need to waste another 5 minutes going through the motions and setting up the same start for your next run.  Each run starts the same way: - a meaningless carriage ride - combat against dirt-easy zombies to get 5 mastery points - a second meaningless carriage ride - spend mastery points (likely on the same skills you mastered last run) - spend and use resources (likely on the same inn/battle items you picked the last run) - try to figure out why you would ever want to equip the offered relics - click on embark - click on embark again (for some reason) - a third meaningless carriage ride  Having fun yet?",0

This can be a little jarring at the beginning for people who loved the first game, but after a couple of expeditions the charm of this game will start to shine through.  This game has a steeper learning curve than the first, but that makes progression and victory very satisfying once you finally achieve it. The combat feels like a big improvement, and although the token system can take a while to get used to, I think it is an objectively better system than what the first game had.   The story has the same quality as the previous title, the lore is not as substantial as the first one but the world building is very intriguing. Exploring the characters' backstories in order to unlock their abilities is also very satisfying.   The game runs very smoothly, there are only a couple of times where the frames drop a little, like in the tangle or sometimes during combat when a lot of things are going on at once, but otherwise it feels very polished.  Red Hook has created another wonderful piece of art in which their care and passion for the project truly shines through and I cannot wait to see what they have in store for the future.",1

Darkest Dungeon felt like a Dungeon Crawler; it was scary, slow, and brutal.   Darkest Dungeon II feels challenging at best when compared to the original. It has some of its spirit, but it just feels like an entirely different game.   Is it good? Probably.  Would I have recommended it; if it didn't carry the Darkest Dungeon name? Probably Is it worth you buying? Really depends on what you want out of it. I wanted Darkest Dungeon; so I feel sort of sad.  I am going to continue to try to love it though.

This is an absolutely annoying and pointless feature added to the game. I'd rather not even have the positive buffs from that than have the possibility of negative ones. There is already enough stuff to deal with.  Don't even get me started on the enemy buffer units that can spam nonstop buffs and get turns before you do.

Cons:  - There are some bugs but that is to be expected since this is an early access release. - The flashlight is way too dim making it hard to see during the night. - The inventory being full but still allowing you to pick up items is very annoying and makes the player waste time trying to free up inventory space, it should just say full and not allow you to pick up more unless you drop something.

There is some self awareness that makes this game more of a comedy which I personally ended up appreciating.

They copied the themes, they copied the abilities, they copied the characters, and then threw them all into an uninspired mobile game / slay the spire clone.

138061152,1940340,"Not gonna lie, this game just did not click for me. I like the first Darkest Dungeon well enough. I'm not a superfan of it or anything, but I think it was good.  I do like the relationship aspect, and I can respect that they tried something different, but the thing that bothers me the most is the interface. Darkest Dungeon was extremely clear in what every icon meant, and it was easy to navigate from characters, to inventory, to various other screens.   Darkest Dungeon 2 feels like it was made for mobile, in terms of where to click. Want to look at a character's stats? Right click their portrait. Can't see their portrait? Too bad. Want to know what that icon is and what it means for your action? Open up a separate tab that shows all of the possible icons and statuses, find it, hover over that icon, and still have more questions. Why can't I just hover over the icon on the screen? I wonder what feedback they got that indicated that the best way to deal with UI clutter is to create an entire screen's worth of icons and definitions, as opposed to just the one I want to know about.  How about preparing for the next expedition, or moving on from the inn? Rather than some clear images / cool UI, they decided to put the buttons to select those preparations at the bottom left of the screen, out of the way. If I want to know what those buttons do, I have to hover over them. Why are they not just in a menu or represented like in DD?  Anyway, most of my dissatisfaction comes from the UI and how cumbersome it is. Were it not for that, I might be able to get into it, but when every screen is a struggle, it's hard to enjoy the dark atmosphere.",0

You need leather to craft a lot of things, but it's the one resource so far that you can't find floating around or at least make out of the stuff you find floating around. For a while I thought you could only get it from the leeches that sometimes latch on to the train or if a station happens to have it as a drop.  Then I accidentally killed one of those little harmless cuttlefish things that fly by. I honestly felt bad, but when I saw that it too dropped leather, I knew what I had to do. It still hurt the next time, watching its brethren flee when they had once peacefully flown alongside the train. Maybe this was just my mind playing tricks on me, but it seemed like the next school of fish didn't get as close to me as they used to.  And yet I knew I couldn't stop.  The train must survive.",1
138061072,1159690,"So.  Train. in the void. Voidtrain.  You go along the track, you collect resources, you upgrade your train. You defend your train. You explore the void around your train as you move forward.  This is my dream game. I want nothing more than to sit in a peaceful void, guiding my train from depot to depot as I build and upgrade it, turning it into a mobile fortress base.  I've been in love with this game since the first demo I don't even know how many years ago. I played this game through endless CTDs on EGS. And now it's finally on steam.  I couldn't tell you what's bad about it, I've long since chosen to look past every grievance I had with it.  That said, in the first 20(?) minutes alone, I can see some big QoL improvements from the last version I played, Mainly with inventory, Far better than it used to be. I could see some people still not liking it, but I think it'll come down to how you like your survival game inventories.  I was going to write more, but honestly, you can probably decide if you want this game or not based on the youtube videos you can find of it.  I'd say the biggest flaw is that the best parts of the game is maybe after the first 15 pages of research, and that can get a bit tedious. When you start unlocking the stuff that gets you away from your train, like puzzles, arenas, and track-side outposts, the game really gets fun and interesting. When your train gets to be about ten platforms long, and you're starting to think about how you want to decorate and organize the carriages, is then it's really shining. That's maybe a bit far in for a lot of people, but because I can just vibe and sit in the void until I get there, I forgive it.  Anyways, I've yet to see another game that lets you build a train, so, until we get it, th is is what we've got. And it could be a lot worse.",1

134799478,2053080,"Simple, clean, fun, and sometimes brutally difficult.  This game recreates the look and feel of an archaic console maze runner. The world is simple, but feels like it was designed with love. The mechanics are instantly understandable, but the game is still challenging to play. Each level presents a different lock-and-key puzzle to try and beat, but the levels aren't so labyrinthine as to cause a headache or so impenetrable as to require a textbook to understand. Some levels are easy, but some are gut-wrenchingly difficult without split-second timing.  On a technical level, there are few faults. Controller support is included, the design is consistent, and the music is minimal but attractive. Achievements are incorporated smoothly into the game, and grinding is not necessary to achieve them. Speedrunners should like this game for its instant memorizability. Combat is fun and challenging, without requiring advanced piano-playing skills. Secrets exist, and are not highlighted or hinted at except thru the achievement system.  All-in-all, it feels like this is a labor of love that the creator took time to flesh out in all dimensions, while maintaining its arbitrary simplicity at all times.

As a pixel art lover, and a pixel artist myself, I have to say this game looks ADORABLE! I love it so much! It has a very retro feel, but with vibrant colours, and the assets are just lovely. I almost didn't want to kill the wolves, because they were so cute. And the little rabbits as well! I also love the CRT filter, it gives it even more charm!

In some levels you have to run, otherwise killing all enemies becomes really hard, but in others you need to kill the bosses to progress.  The pixel art and the music are great, some of the animals end up looking really cute and the 8-bit style of music is very fitting.  Very recommended.",1

Some zones are a bit challenging but still a lot of fun! If you like retro games this is a must, especially on sale! Also the story is charming and simple, like a little medieval fantasy tale.",1
138059466,2389700,"Review copy* (also I will buy one copy for a friend to support the game)  This 30-minute psychological horror story is from the developer of the [b] 'I live under your house' [/b] and offers a similar narrative experience. The game is essentially a visual novel with first-person segments, and just like the first game, it's not so much a game that tries to scare you, but more of a thought-provoking experience (hopefully).   Truthfully I didn't fully understand the story, I assume you are meant to apply it to yourself, I guess it's a bit obscure on purpose, and even if I gave you my theory, it probably would be too much of a spoiler - it's a short game, there are only so many things I can talk about without explaining the entire experience. I thought the themes in the second half of the game were handled a bit better, I assume those are homebrew sound effects in the first segment, I would recommend being a bit more subtle with the sound choices because if they are over the top, it might feel too cheesy, sometimes it's better to have less than more. That said, toward the end of the game I felt the mood felt more concentrated, and the music reminded me of something like Silent Hill, I think you should find a more balanced and consistent theme and stick with it.   Similar to the feedback I gave you with the last game, I kinda want to see you explore the character more, and I get that maybe you don't want to say too much, but I feel we are just scratching the surface, I want the game to get more personal and really nail that feeling of despair (you not planning on adding DLC again are you XD, it's cool if you do though).  [h1] Pros: [/h1]  (+) Just like with the previous game and its DLC, I feel like you found that sweet spot with making an obscure game that kind of gives you just enough mystery to keep going, but not giving you all the answers. I always enjoy stories where there is some space for interpretation and speculation.   (+) I feel like you getting the mood right in some spots of the game, but to me it does not feel like a consistent theme in terms of soundtrack and the effects. Some of the sound effects this time were a bit cheesy, so you want to be more careful with that. The atmosphere in the game mostly comes from the music or a good use of silence, you are kinda doing it right, but I am getting these weird bumps where maybe this spot of the game should have another ambient song, or maybe this effect should not be so cheesy.  [h1] Feedback: [/h1]  [u] General [/u] - so it's not so much that you are doing anything wrong, like with the previous game I feel like you are cutting the experience too short. For example, I feel like the last game and the DLC should have been just the normal experience, I want you to explore the character and give more context for more than 30 minutes. The interaction with the knight was interesting, I think you could rely more on having some cerebral dialogue as well of that kind, or maybe even have more optional exploration, you did some in the last game, and this one seems to be missing that aspect.  The mood is slightly off, I liked the sound/music choices you made in the second half, but in the first half I felt they were a bit cheesy, or maybe even empty, I think the game needs more ambiance to go along.  [b] Overall Thoughts: 6/10 [/b]  I enjoyed the experience for what it was, although I think I liked the last game a bit more, not sure if you gonna do the DLC like the last time to give more closure. I like the way you approach the psychological design and overall obscurity of the narrative, I just want to see you elaborate more on the personal struggle, and maybe rely more on the optional interactions as well, even having more weird characters might be helpful.

138057234,2366910,"Michi is an autobattler game that combines some of my favorite elements from other games like Slay the Spire, Super Auto Pets, and Teamfight Tactics. The game has a unique blend of strategy and luck that keeps each match feeling fresh and exciting.  One thing I love about Michi is the relaxing music that plays throughout the game. It's a nice touch that helps me unwind while I'm making tough decisions during battles. Additionally, the cute art style is a welcome departure from the more serious or gritty aesthetic of other games in this genre.  The gameplay is easy to pick up, but there's a lot of depth in the strategy and decision-making. Each round presents new challenges and opportunities, and I love experimenting with different team compositions to see what works best.  Overall, Michi is a fantastic autobattler that I'd highly recommend to anyone who enjoys this type of game. It's fun, engaging, and has a charm all its own. Give it a try!",1
138063332,2262610,picked this up so i could finally buy hcnone a burger,1
138064407,2311190,this game is really bad first off i still have no clue what is my motive. i know they say its to find my kids but that is as far as they go. many rooms feel barren and empty and they just reused areas but they feel lower quality now. the enemyies go from being your friend to wanting to kill you for no reason i can figure out like the pink bird want to kill you in the first 2 chapters now he doesn't and the teacher want to kill you the last chapter and now just wants you to just to come back and learn? the puzzles this time are just annoying and a feel like a waste of time and the final area is the worst you just go through a bunch of doors it got to the point were i made two Roblox doors reference like i only should have had to make one. the game still feels lifeless and it is the worst out of the Garten of ban ban series so far.,0

138061560,2311190,"Oh my gosh I don't even know where to begin with this piece of art. The first 2 games have heavily impacted me in the best way possible with their great soundtracks, gorgeous graphics, deep lore, and lovable characters. But this one, this one is easily the best of the 3. From its nail-biting cutscenes and riveting gameplay, Garten of Banban III is easily the best game ive ever played. The puzzles were extremely fun, like the Jumbo Josh puzzle. For me, that was a very fair and exciting part of the game and was the pinnacle of gaming. As a delved deeper into the Garten, the graphics made me feel like I wasthe player and I got shocked when I realized it was just a game. The beautiful violin in all the trailers is what sold me to delve deeper. So, you still might be asking, ""Is this game really worth buying?"" and to that I say, ""Yes, yes it is, it waill change your life and tour way of thinking for years to come"".  10/10 Made me cry multiple times (of joy)",1

It has solid mechanics with a low entry point and high skill cap. While the online is still barebones since it's still in beta, the netcode run great and I felt barely any lag at all.  Also, for those that don't like playing online, there is the ""Virtual Frontier"", a mode that seemlessly integrates rogue-like mechanics in a somewhat of a story mode for the single-players. Lastly, there are also plans for future updates and characters, and with what the devs have put out so far and how fast and frequent patches and updates have gone out since release, I'm pretty confident that this game would only get better with time.",1

I don't understand why would you ruin a very good core mechanic game design formula like this instead of just improving upon it? At this point Black Reliquary mod is more DD2 than this for me.  If I evaluate this game as a completely new game with darkest dungeon characters and graphics, it's just not for me for this price.",0

138064341,1940340,"As someone who found the first Darkest Dungeon to be charming and entertaining but who never really ""clicked"" with it, and as someone who has poured thousands of hours into roguelite games, DD2 is a damn dream come true.  If you're looking for a strict upgrade to the original Darkest Dungeon, this game is not that. Red Hook has managed to find a fresh take on their own franchise, and the result is a game that plays very, very differently from the first. Gone is the town and roster micromanagement--it's replaced with roguelite progression, and a single character for each class that maintain certain progressions between runs.  Runs themselves are a couple hours in length, roughly comparable to Dead Cells. The combat gameplay is slightly more complex while also remaining streamlined and stylish. Between fights, there's a Slay-the-Spire inspired progression tree as you climb ever closer to the mountain.  Overall, the game maintains the punishing, brutal atmosphere of the first Darkest Dungeon while making it feel new, evolved, and streamlined with careful intent. If you just want more Darkest Dungeon, play Darkest Dungeon. If you want something that's grown FROM Darkest Dungeon (you know, the way a sequel should), buy this game.  It's really good, y'all.  Really, really good.",1

138063962,1606350,"I decided to give this a shot because it seemed interesting, however I was disappointed by the gameplay. There are multiple issues that make this game unfun to play. First and foremost, there is absolutely no explanation of the rule variant anywhere, so you're forced to try to learn on the fly. You'll soon find that this game is very fast paced, with only a few minutes on your move timer, so learning while playing is easier said than done. There should be a tutorial or an offline practice mode—or both.  My next complaint is that the move timer / turn indicator is small and in the upper corner of the screen, and in this hectic format, I didn't find myself looking at it often, as I was busy scanning the board. It would be nice to somehow make this more visible—perhaps there's a way to tie it into the cursor, so that the move timer and turn indication follows your mouse movements. As it stands, it's very easy to lose on time or to find yourself in a time crunch.  Additionally, there is an issue where players may have nearly identical colors—sometimes yourself and an opponent and sometimes two opponents. This is frustrating as it becomes very difficult to tell which pieces belong to whom. There needs to be a way to prevent this from happening.  Overall, I just found the game hectic and frustrating—not fun. There is promise to this game, but I can't recommend it in its current state, and I have chosen to request a refund. This game could be fun, but it needs more time in the oven first. It needs more features and refinement.",0
138065389,1730250,"Beautifully made game. It’s a very fun game if you are looking to clear your mind and relax. I beat the game in about 2 hours while having fun the whole time.

I’m very excited to see what lies for the future of this game.",1
138065016,1730250,"Good game! Very relaxing and beautiful.   However, it is a bit short. I beat the game on my first run - a little over 3 hours. Wish there were a harder difficulty that could be unlocked or something. The objective and win condition of the game is to find all buildings and once you have, there is nothing new to do. Alternatively, unlocking new buldings/textures/animals etc. between runs would increase replayability. Also, the end was a bit underwhelming.   Still recommend for people looking for something cozy to wind down to though.",1

138062324,1730250,"Recommended by Real Civil Engineer.  It's fun! The obvious comparison is to Dorfromatik, except in Dorf you need to match tile sides together and complete quests to get more turns, in this game you complete quests and build special structures to get more turns.  Dorf feels more like a puzzle game than this. For most of my playtime I feel Panorama is a cute relaxing tile game that happens to have limited turns. I didn't notice the turn count until the very end and found it much less difficult than Dorf. In 3 hours I unlocked almost all of the tiles in the game, and on a second playthrough I feel I could unlock them all.  As a puzzle game, play it for the zen and cute and not the brain teasing.",1

138065507,1742020,"It's a fun game, but issues do appear very quickly. I should mention that I don't play fighter games, but do play almost every PvP game, just like everyone here. Game doesn't have bugs(many or noticeable, at least) and every character is unique, while multiplayer is day 1 available and pretty fun. Combos are doable, and tutorial is readable but hard to understand. A very fun 1v1 game. And fixes are very quick. Up till now, only positives.   Some degenerate mechanics that I cannot understand and leads to wicked gameplay: 1. Animation cancelling - I don't know how this is valuable for fighting games, but as far as I can see, you can get stunned forever. You can be rendered unable to react to enemy abilities and enemy can use the same ability 3 times in a row. What I believe this does is remove any reaction posibilities from players, and leads to button mashing to stun the enemy into death. One good example is Ayame keeping you in the air until you lose half your health or your burst comes back. You will get combo'd to death with no reaction, since all hits are instant. Can't hit back when you can cancel animation locks and channels. Examples: Akirose teleporting 3 times in 1 second and grabbing into stun, Ayame knockups, Botan throwing 4 bombs in 1 second.  2. There is too much damage and too little health. You have characters with abilities that don't use any resources, just require getting close, that deal 20-25% HP. This is wildly unfun, since taking 3 of these spells is enough to die, while all that is required for enemy is waiting with guard up, and then dashing in close range. Even one spell that you cannot dodge(Coco pushing you into the air 'cuz you are too close) will do 30% of your health. You cannot express any skill. You're sitting there for 2 seconds in an animation, lose 1/3 your health to an undodgeable spell, and say ""what could I have done?"".  3. AI not having to actually do the moves necessary to cast, use spells, or grab, is also degenerate. It's hard to train when the AI can react to anything in 0.01 seconds without having to move left, right and press Special.   TLDR: Fun game, animation, art, characters, and it's Hololive. Multiplayer awesome. Degen mechanics predominate with too much damage, oneshot combos, unreactable fights with stunlock, animation cancelling leading to no counterplay and staring at screen.",0

Now I'm really coming around to this game and loving it. There are so many minor changes to combat that just make it a lot more dynamic and less gimmicky. In the original game, the accuracy system, stunning, and dodge all could be cheesed a bit too excessively. All three of these areas have been improved, and each run feels more unique than each run in the original game. The relationships between characters impacting abilities is one of my favorite changes, now each run certain abilities may have additional positives or negatives causing me to change my play style mid game.

138066062,1940340,"By all accounts it is far too early for me to give an informed review, that said I think other people interested in this should be aware that this game was made to be functionally similar but different to the original Darkest Dungeon.  Should Red Hook be applauded for straying from the formula for success? I certainly tip my hat to a team that will try new ideas that shake up the core gameplay.   For now I don't see any reason to give this a thumbs down. My only complaint so far is that my party members didn't like each other in the boss fight and turned against each other verbally after the first meltdown, this had a domino effect on the others stress levels and they all spiralled in turn. Oh and now heroes even spend their turns on the reactions itself, you have to manually click a forced action and watch what it does, just to really sink in how bad you fucked up.  Anyway such is the nature of Darkest Dungeon and its sequel. I highly encourage everybody to read the message before you jump into gameplay and remember deaths are expected, needed to make the gruelling journey required of you to win.  If you're put off by the game straying from the original formula then I don't think it is for you. Personally speaking I grabbed the game at full price because I wanted to see the new direction they took the sequel and so far at least my disappointment has been tempered with equal excitement, I sure do miss the atmospheric dungeon crawling but I look forward to seeing how this game pans out.",1

138066411,2234890,THIS GAME IS AWESOME,1
138066649,1159690,"This is one of those Next Fest games I played and was really looking forward to. Unfortunately it did not deliver, rather the final game is worse than the demo.   1. The game suffers severe optimization issues. In the demo I had between 40-60 FPS. In the final game, I'm constantly below 30 FPS and had massive frame pacing and stuttering issues. Turning down settings didn't help. The main issue is I think there is too many objects on the screen, and it was bad in the demo, but now there is even more things in the scene, so it brought my machine to its knees, even on Low everything. And I ran the demo at Ultra.   2. The character customization is terrible. You can never create a character like the one shown off in the cover art. Also you have this mark on your face that isn't explained anywhere and cannot be removed. So your character is permanently ugly, no matter what settings you choose. We were promised after Next Fest, this would get addressed, and it didn't.   3. The controls are still as bad the Next Fest. You are stuck on a ""leash"" so you can't venture far and collecting resources is still just as tedious. You constantly have to stop the train and reverse it to grab resources, as your swim speed is slow and the tether/leash is too short. Finally, the pull yourself up with the rope still doesn't work and still doesn't pull you up and onto the train.  4. Pacing is still as bad as it was in the Next Fest, so you are expected to trudge through 1.5 hours of miserable gameplay, before you reach the good stuff. Assuming there is good stuff. At least it took me 1.5 hours in the demo to reach good stuff. And the start in the final game is exactly like how the demo was so... yeah...  5. Building things on the train is still super costly and time consuming to advance progression. Also, you drain your food faster than the demo, so have fun keeping that bar filled.   =====  Overall, if you didn't like the Next Fest demo, this build is 2-3x worse in all aspects. If you did like the demo, and was fine with the pacing, it would probably still be okay, but you may not be able to get good performance like I am suffering with. Overall huge let down, and for the price of 30 USD I expected better. Much better.",0

138066023,1582380,"Assuming save games have been updated to actually load, read on!  https://youtu.be/VOgbEjkj-wE The storytelling of Midautumn is, for better and worst, the best part of the experience. If you can relate to being a first or second generation American, or if you love getting insight into other cultural experiences, Midautumn handles its themes well. Robin’s grandmother just drops the powers into her lap and expects her to figure it out. An early story beat features a young boy wanting to ask Robin’s grandmother for help, which Robin encourages, only for her grandmother to tell the boy that Robin can help.  Yeah, the problems of the world are on your shoulders, and good luck getting any help with that!  Combat has a fascinating premise. You absorb your enemies’ ranged attacks, which give you charges that can be used to attack enemies. But if you wait too long, attacking costs health. There’s a sweet spot to land criticals if you wait just long enough, but the window is probably too tight for a casual player. The adjustment to this type of combat is exasperated by the game’s first mini-boss and by the Debt Blow rooms, where you have to survive while your companion strikes enemies first. While you’re in a fairly small room. The close quarters combat of Midautumn does set it apart from other isometric roguelites. I just wish it felt better to play. Part of the problem with difficulty might be a balancing issue, and to Midautumn’s credit, there are settings to adjust both your and enemies’ health and damage.  As with any early access title, there is hope for the future. And I hope Midautumn improves, because I’m curious to learn more about its plot. If you’re interested, wishlist it for now, but wait until updates before you consider buying it. In its current state it’s a pass.",0

138068434,1269300,"As someone who played 60+ hours on FTL and a big lover of co-op games, I was stoked to see this game coming out. After playing for more than 15 hours, I concluded that I cannot recommend this game, unfortunately.  There are 3 main reasons.   Firstly, the difficulty is unbalanced and is probably mathematically impossible to beat on hard or nightmare. You start with 2 weapons, but cannot add more throughout the run (unlike FTL). On the other hand, the enemies will start with 1 and get more as the run progress, to a max of 5. On top of that, the HP of said enemies weapons will start at the equivalent of 1 attack and will increase every encounter, which, eventually, will require 5 or 6 attacks. Even with a maxed-out DMG perk character and a blue or purple or golden weapon and upgrades. Keep in mind that repairing (for enemies too) takes the same amount of time even if it's for 1 HP or 40 HP. So the difficulty is not linear, it is exponential. If you doubt what I'm saying here, just go ahead and check how many people have the achievement ""Nightmare: Defeat the final boss on hard""  Secondly, AI is terrible. I could elaborate, but just read other reviews and you will get an idea. As an example, the bots use and waste buffs between encounters while not even being in combat. Why? Another example is when they use bombs, they shoot randomly which sometimes make them land directly at the incinerator, basically making them useless.  Thirdly, the upgrades and loot feel a little bland. It would be cool to add some systems like door upgrades, cloaking, physical combat, etc., just like in FTL.  The game has HUGE potential, and I really wanted to love it. I like running around and repairing stuff. I like the overall chaos, just like in overcooked. The mini-games between combats are fun.  But not being able to complete a single run after 15 hours, even at easy difficulty, is such a bummer and not fun. I cannot even get to try the other scenarios... At the current state of the game, I cannot recommend it.  Also, why can't I play with my buddy with Steam remote play together and choose online mode so we can fill the match? It's possible in other games like Plate-up.  Will update my review if it get patches for new content or balance changes.",0
138067728,1269300,"Start with some FTL style mechanics and theming, throw in some Overcooked style teamwork and time based action, and wrap it all up in a Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime feel. But then, make it technical and make it challenging!  Should you try to blow up their weapons or perhaps blow up their walls and have the vacuum of space suffocate them?  Between rogue-lite style combats and upgrades, there are charming mini-games that can gain you supplies to stay ahead of the curve. No matter your RNG, you can always make the most of your situation.  Single player mode is good. You'll have to rely on the AIs, which are okay at some jobs and terrible at others. Learning to use them right is necessary for success. In co-op mode, you'll have to rely on other actual people. Depending on who they are, this could go well or much worse! Be careful who you trust to man the weapons. AI or human could mess that up.  I'm hoping to see more guides come soon, as there is a lot of depth to the gameplay that isn't obvious at first. Start on easy mode as you learn the game. You won't win on your first several tries, but you'll learn and improve each time!",1

138069365,1940340,"I bought this game on release on Steam. I have been waiting for it for a while. I knew it was going to be a road trip so that didn't bother me. I knew there was friendship stuff between characters also didn't bother me. I mean games do have to try something new once in a while. I am enjoying the graphics and general game play though only a few hours in at the time of this review. I really think people will enjoy it if they just pick it up and play it for what it is. I will say at the moment though in my excitement about the game I can't say I fully thought love or hate the game. I just think it's something worth adding to a collection of games. I do though have this feeling while I am playing that always seems to come back though to me. That this should have been the darkest dungeon 1 ""the road trip"" and the darkest dungeon 1 should have been the darkest dungeon 2 "" the actual dungeon crawling."" Though I can see myself playing this for a while anyways. I don't know if they need more content because I am still starting out at this point,  but I still think they still need to keep working on this one to make it truly the best it can be.  Things I like -graphics are nice and flow together well. I like that they seemed to bring our darkest dungeon characters more to life including the monsters. -I actually enjoy the little stories for whatever reason  -I like the friendship stuff between characters though could be complex after a while if your characters live long enough.   Things that bother me  -I really don't think the skills should cause damage to your other characters or make them less stressed. It's forcing you away from a skill that might be useful or forcing you towards one that might be crappy. I think it's one thing in DD1 when characters just hurt each other cause they were crazy. Now like ""Don't blind Timmy with your mace ability, but don't worry nothing is wrong with you...just don't use your mace.""  -Somewhere I kind of miss the dungeon crawling in an actual dungeon...yes, I know the road is the dungeon. I am just having a DD1 moment. -Somewhere in the future probably need to implement cloud saving, but at the moment doesn't bother me but something that may need to be done for folks.",1
138069331,1940340,"I've finished the game, and let me tell ya.. There's not a lot of content here, apart from the bosses it's all the same mobs and mechanics throughout the game. It gets boring REAL fast. The coach traveling between points just drags out the game, probably to add playtime to what would be a very fast playthrough. Fights are very RNG based on the death toll system, I've had elite mobs take 5-6 times to finally kill.  All 5 acts are bland, uninteresting and seems rushed in production. Also, the asking price is way too high for what this game offers.  I'd rate it 3/10 i guess.. Steer away.",0
138069251,1940340,"I played ~250 hours of Darkest Dungeon 1 including dlcs + silvio's hardcore mod.  DD2 is an acquired tased, but it's easily superior to its predecessor once you've acquired it. Tactical gameplay is much less spammy and more dynamic and while I miss dungeon-crawling the strategy layer does give you a lot more to think about.  I'm only 7 hours in but I'm optimistic that DS2 will get more complex and engaging as I get deeper into it.  Worth full price if you're a fan of the genre, worth it on sale if you're not sure — but be warned that the game doesn't take form until you're well past the 2 hour return window.",1

138068967,1940340,"Most negative reviews on here are going to point out one thing. Its not Darkest Dungeon 1. While that is both a positive and negative. This game is still a hell of a lot of fun. While it lacks in many mechanics from the first game you will surely miss its still solid in it's own. If you're iffy due to negative reviews, wait for a sale. But definitely give it a shot.",1
138068882,1940340,"I will be blasphemous and say this is better than Darkest Dungeon. Now, mind you, that does not mean Darkest Dungeon is/was a bad game. Obviously, you can look at the reviews for it. Darkest Dungeon is an extremely hardcore dungeon romper that alienated a lot of people due to its brutal difficulty, and I only truly began to enjoy it when the Radiant mode came out. The original focused heavily on survival-based mechanics, and required you to balance a multitude of heroes so others can rest from the horrors, and also properly managing resources to dungeon-delve. Darkest Dungeon could be so brutal to the point that you may need to restart the entire game to succeed.  Darkest Dungeon 2 cuts a lot of the frustrations that Darkest Dungeon is known for, and combined it with a rogue-like style akin to Slay the Spire, or games like it. With this, it means you do not get all the items, heroes, or the many ways of aiding your party and wagon at the beginning. No, you will need to go through the dungeon, which is split into chapters, all the way to the chapter's boss. Along the way, you will collect Candles of Hope, which in turn makes every run, no matter how disastrous, feel rewarding to an extent as you will be able to unlock more features.  A lot of games are doing this style now, as it keeps you on the progression hamster wheel, and I personally enjoy this style, because you inch a little towards the goal regardless. Darkest Dungeon, while it did have things you could do to ease the journey a bit, still felt truly punishing and sometimes reward-less, to the point where you may feel you wasted X amount of hours playing.  Darkest Dungeon 2 slims the frustrations, and keeps a lot of what made Darkest Dungeon so enjoyable, and in my opinion, expands upon it. Darkest Dungeon never really elaborated on the background behind any of the heroes, and while maybe some people felt more connected to losing one, I never really felt that attached. Each hero has multiple 'chapters' which you may select at a specific building along a route, that tells you the backstory little-by-little of each one. This connects you more to them, because you are aware of how they came to be who they are now.  Stress is also better balanced in Darkest Dungeon 2. Stress is no longer a mechanic that can literally break your run immediately, and while it can be painful, it is typically manageable. There are also plenty of ways to lower the stress of your heroes. As in the original, there is a 20% chance that stress build is actually beneficial, so it is a gamble.  Relationships are a new mechanic added and may be just as stressful as, well, stress. This is essentially an interaction between 2 people in your party, and they can either gain a boon, depending on how they've been interacting, or a negative. This adds again some more flavor and makes it feel like your party is actually 4 unique individuals, rather than where in the first, it kind of felt like you were a commander forcing people into the depths.  Graphics have been expanded upon to an extent as well, since there are more 3D environments and the heroes themselves look more 3d but still feel like the same aesthetic. Sound is solid like the first, and features the narrator we all love again. He is seemingly a different character, and you learn bits of pieces of how you and him were connected in the past. Again, this game delves into the lore behind everyone which is great.  Overall, if Darkest Dungeon was an 8/10, I'd give this currently a 9/10. It trims the fat (in my opinion) from the first, and expands upon it, while feeling even if you play for 10 minutes that you can gain some sort of progression.",1

It's extremely linear, as many have already said.  It's a real pity Epic do not allow 'reviews' as this might have been fixed enough to play by now - this has been on Epic for a very long time now, as an exclusive (maybe 2 years?) - I genuinely believed by the time Steam got this game it would be highly polished - gee, I was Sooooooo wrong!  It feels like they've just started developing the game, like only a couple months ago, but it has been on sale on Epic for nearly 2 years(?)    I've only ever been able to equip the hammer to 'relocate' stuff once, it won't come off the construction book the rest of the time - the dev's must have been sitting on their hands believing their game was a success on Epic - because there are no means to give feedback like here on Steam - hence why I stopped playing my Epic version within a week of initial release (must be nearly 2 years!)

138068783,1159690,"It's been a while since I've played a game that made me consistently frustrated.  *Main Menu - music is insanely loud and hyper. Had to turn it off so I could focus on figuring out how to play.  *Character Customization - character constantly sways back and forth, so it's hard to get a lock onto what you're doing when customizing. Even at the best settings, you can't make your character as pretty as the advertisement. The settings don't make much sense. The color presets don't quite match what shows up on the character. The UI is not intuitive at all, either.   *Gameplay - there is not much as far as tutorials go, so you are blindly guessing along the way when figuring out how things work or what to do. The hit boxes for the containers, which start out with a capacity of 4 slots, are strange. If you're trying to float up above the train to collect resources, the train will pull you back down onto the platform. This makes you have to stop the train several times to collect everything. The tether is short and the movement speed is slow, so you are constantly frustrated about trying to gather resources.  Your food/hunger meter tapers down pretty fast, and a lot faster than you can collect resources to eat.  The platform of the train gets cramped really fast and the game offers no explanation on how to expand it until you stumble upon it at the first gate.   The only things you can interact with at the first station/gate are the occasional containers, although the map is full of containers that you can't interact with at all. The only resources you can collect are wood and scrap, which makes this part very monotonous. It was underwhelming.  The narrator's voice acting is great, but the writing is beyond questionable. Awkward, not at all funny, and oddly timed. It was far less useful to the player, even though this seems to be the only thing that would help tutorial-wise.  *Pacing and Progression - it feels like it will take ages to reach each stage, gate, story progression, etc. Doing the smallest steps in research and building takes a while because of how many resources it consumes, which makes you need to gather more resources that are spread out pretty far, which you can't reach because you have to move the train section by section due to the short tether, and the list goes on.  Overall: the concept of this game is absolutely amazing, but the game is just not user friendly. It is far too limiting at the beginning. Every single aspect is awkward, frustrating, confusing, and unintuitive. This game has the potential to be fun if every feature of the game wasn't so limiting. It is not worth $30.",0

Luckily, I find myself in the most fortuitous of positions, where the game has been beaten in under 2 hours, and I will be able to feed myself once again with the refunded money I spent on this experience. In totality, I think GoBB could, in theory, be good. However, I do feel that the game suffers from a most debilitating flaw: It just want's my god damn $5. I can forgive the terrible voice acting, the clunky, slow gameplay, and even the nightmarighly bad pacing. But what I can't forgive, is that this is all done to hold on to less that a subway footlong. Which, as everyone knows, is no longer $5, which honestly, I feel is a waste. I mean, really, why did the $5 foot long go up like, double the price. I mean yeah, if I get cheese and mayo I can see why there might be a small add up, but an entire $5 or $6 increase just seems a bit much. Don't be like subway and make these games any more expensive, because both are like inhaling a literal pile of liquid trash. So, you know, try. Just...just try next time.

138069821,2311190,"Garten of Banban 3 is truly a masterpiece of its time. With many difficult puzzles and challenging boss fights, it will be fun for the whole family. The unique characters really brighten the gameplay along with it's masterfully crafted storyline. I'd rate this game higher and nominate it for an award if I how the power to do so.   I also had to play one handed when Jumbo Josh CAME onto my screen, god I love him so much. Please, in Garten of Banban 4 add a highly detailed Jumbo Josh s*x scene between Banban and Banbaleena!",1

138071188,2055910,"I've bought all this developer's games because they're simple yet fun and challenging. This one is no exception. It's actually VERY HARD, but that's part of what keeps me playing-you can play for a few seconds, a few minutes, even a few hours as you keep trying to push yourself to higher scores and beat those challenges. If you like the developer's previous games this one is a no-brainer pickup, even at a higher price tag which is justified to help support him. If you're new to these games, try some of the earlier ones to get a feel for the gameplay then if you like those, come back and get this one. But as a fan of this developer and his games I enthusiastically recommend it.",1
138071360,1940340,Was disappointed when i heard they changed the formula from DD1 but after playing a bit im happy with the changes. Much different from the 1st but its fun and fresh so. Its also much less frustrating while still challenging. Would def recommend,1

138071326,1940340,"DARKEST DUNGEON 1 PLAYERS PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING  DD2 is a fun and approachable standard 3 map rogulite with much of the great art and style of DD1. However, you have to go into this experience with the full understanding that this game is NOTHING LIKE Darkest Dungeon 1.  In the first game, there was a steep learning curve as the game punished you over and over again while you tried desperately to keep as many of your characters alive as possible through murky mechanics and unforgiving RNG. Over time, you learn the systems and improve all of your different recovery and gearing locations so that you get your people surviving longer and with better item prep. You got to know the ins and outs, the strength and weaknesses, and the quirks of each of the members of your teams. In the end, weeks... months.... years later, you may get to beat the game.  DD2 has none of that. As a standard 3 map roguelite, the whole point of the game now is to charge in and experiment aggressively. Once you get to the farthest inn you think you can make it to, you end the game, collect your candles to invest in the meta game, and get ready to try again; just like every other 3 map roguelike in exsistance.  So, this game is faster and more accessible with great art, and interesting story and approach and it has some interesting twists on the standard roguelite, but that is still what you are going to get this time. The irony is, they spent way more time in this game giving each ""character"" a back story and development, but in the end, there is no development as they just die and come back over and over with extremely limited permanency. You invest absolutely NOTHING in any one character despite the game saying you do. Instead, you are investing in the entire CLASS of character. Each individual means nothing.  In the end, if you are looking for a more polished DD1, this is NOT it. If you are looking for a much more normal roguelight set in the same universe as DD1 than you are good to go and will have a blast!",1
138071324,1940340,good,1
138071253,1940340,"Darkest Dungeon II retains the misery and charm of its predecessor with a new take on the core gameplay loop. Rather than embarking on a single massive campaign, you will find yourself embarking on a series of smaller expeditions, typically with a fresh cast of heroes. The game intends for you to progress as far as you can, fail, and collect a currency based on your progress that will allow you to power up your future expeditions. It is a roguelite formula reminiscent of Rogue Legacy. You will try, die, upgrade, and try again. Experimentation and adaptation are encouraged, and you will always make some amount of progress towards your end goal no matter how many times you fail. If you enjoyed the original game and want to try a fresh take on those mechanics, or if you thought the original game's campaign was too much of a commitment, consider giving this a try.",1
138071244,1940340,"Personally i think the game is pretty good, but it's too different from the original which is either a good thing or a bad thing. i also find the removal of some characters pretty ridiculous, but the games fun. not worth 58 dollars though lol",1

138071150,1940340,Not a fan for the endless loop and lack of progression feel.  It just seems like Ground Hog Day to me.,0
138071074,1940340,"If you're looking for a sequel then go and play Black Reliquary. It is a free mod that does it better than DD2. This game, well, let's just say that it is a rather bold take on the beloved series. I still like the game and recommend it, and there was a lot of love put into it, but it is clearly not for die hard DD1 fans. No dungeons, expendable heroes and LOTS OF GRIND. You die again, again and again until you've accumulated enough upgrades to clear the region. And ooooooh boy! You're gonna die a lot. The combat is similar, but somehow UI feels really convoluted. Took me about 6 hours to become familiar with how the game works.  What else? Art style is as gorgeous as ever. Narrator's voice is perfect. The overall atmosphere is fantastic, but, imho, it is slightly ruined by one not so little detail... The stagecoach... This part of the gameplay somehow feels like a cheap and clunky mobile game. Very questionable gameplay decision. The regions are randomly generated, and in my opinion it would've helped A LOT if there were MORE details on the road to make the generated world believable. Because it really feels like a NES/Mega Drive racing game. The immersion breaks apart and the world feels less alive, underdetailed and artificial. Dungeons from the DD1 were more immersive and believable. Something really needs to be done about this part of the gameplay.",1
138071016,1940340,"When the RNG is fixed, even in the ballpark, it'll be ok? I've been looking forward to this for over a year, and I'm incredibly dissatisfied. I'm fine with hard games before you lose your mind, dear reader, but being locked out of player action for FOURTEEN TURNS CONSECUTIVELY((verified by the person watching me do it and physically counting out loud)) from nearly full to party wipe is honestly the least fun I've had with a new game in a long time. There just isn't -any- redeeming fun or action in the gameplay that overrides the feeling of ""You lose because we decided you lose."" And that, is unacceptable.   I can't recommend this until it's a game where the players play it sometimes.   I really, REALLY want it to be good. ((For Red Hook, you're CLOSE. The slopes are too slippery. I BELIEVE))",0

138071345,1159690,so as much as i would love to give a positive recommendation i can not. 1. albeit was a epic exclusive when You release on steam You should not REQUIRE that the game opens through epic there are reasons that people buying on steam refused to buy on epic devs You should respect that. 2. the tutorial is prohibitively long and if You put an option in the settings to turn off the tutorial it should turn off,0

138071151,1159690,"Raft, but on a train, in space! What could go wrong?  Everything, unfortunately. Everything could go wrong. And most things did! The space swimming is slow, a little faster if you swim-dash. Resources are scattered about in front of, to the sides and above you... and I do mean scattered, as in ""gathering enough material to make stuff takes ages"".  Oh, and everything on your train is destructible, except the foundation I suppose. Not sure if that means things explode into dust, or just get 'ruined' and can be rebuilt with resources, but once the space-mines start drifting in, it's easy enough to get half your laboriously constructed array of crafting stations busted down to 25% durability or so, which feels like a good time for repairs.  The repairs cost a lot. This exacerbates the slow gathering problem. I got a grappling hook, about two hours in. It doesn't help much, except for hunting space leather-fish. Yes, we're in space, or rather the mysterious Void, and what wondrous substances do we have to capture and fuel the imagination? Lump of organic matter. Lump of random chemicals (which in technical terms means basically anything in existence). Lump of wood. Lump of scrap metal. Large bits of scrap are useless, you have to find tiny ones and pile them up in ridiculous quantities. And wood, to burn, to melt the scrap into iron ingots. Then you make a dozen or so kinds of parts out of the ingots.  Sometimes the train stops at a vaguely randomized outpost station, and you shoot some really generic guys. They look human, but the narrator seems to insist they're not really people. Who knows - or cares? They're certainly bland enough to be zombie stormtroopers born of some burnt out shooter designer's very laziest efforts. They drop weapon parts sometimes, but not often enough that I - about three hours into it all - got to experience anything other than the crappy starting pistol and a few unhelpful variations on it (think: plus extra projectiles in exchange for lower accuracy, but the extra projectiles don't actually work... oops).  Three hours in, there was no sign of anything resembling Raft's nets, something to help you collect resources without swimming after or personally hooking every single scrap of wood for the furnaces. Maybe it comes later, but they've lost me already. I'm not going to keep playing something so utterly bland and joyless, with such uninspired writing and a narrator who really doesn't need to be there... just in the hopes that ""maybe it gets better later on"". Sometimes you just know; a ship sailing rudderlessly, or under a confused captain who doesn't really seem to understand how ships work, is probably not going anywhere you want to be.  The whole thing is just so joyless, dull, repetitive, and misses any kind of chill or cozy vibe by miles. Highly disrecommended.",0
138070997,1159690,"After getting killed for the second time while I was on my way to my corpse, the game glitched out leaving me to need to close and reboot it.  Not sure why I seem to randomly and suddenly change facing - it might be something that happens during combat but it is frustrating rather than nifty.  No other game does this - there is a good reason why.  Gameplay itself I would call 'tedious'.  I am going to continue with my testing to see if it gets better but honestly it is a 'WTF is the point of this shit'.  People deride 'railroading the plot' - in this there is only one railroad with no choices for the player.  At all.",0
138070975,1159690,"This game isn't bad but it isn't good. It's a perfectly serviceable game. It's a little slow, crafting mechanics feel like a pain due to severely limited inventory and the fact that seemingly every bad guy will drop a worthless gun part. storage containers hold 4 inventory spaces which is frankly ridiculous. Combat feels weak and apathetic. The game struggles with balancing mandatory combat and survival mechanics. By the time I get forced into another combat encounter I just feel annoyed because I haven't had time to craft what I want.  The pacing is painfully slow, much more so since you'll want to slow the train way down to collect resources, otherwise you'll be flying from combat encounter to combat encounter with none of the upgrades you'll need to make them less annoying. The premise is interesting and in thee first few hours I found the narrator charming and the writing decent. The setting looks cool at first but my eyes glaze over after seeing the same floating rocks over and over and over again.   Unfortunately I would not recommend this game in it's current state unless you just really enjoy survival games.",0

Especially when nearly every single review is all grouped together and saying the same generic thing.  I am super glad I did with this game. This is a gem. This game is fantastic, works well in multiplayer, has a super immersive atmosphere, and is fun. It feels like a cool combination of Breathedge and Raft. Big fun and I look forward to the future of the game. I do recommend it and I also recommend ignoring all of the very blatant and obvious review bombing.",1

138071368,1582380,"It's Day One for Midautumn and I had to jump on here and give my first thoughts!  First of all, this is an early access game and the game devs have been clear about this on the Steam page and in the game, so I wasn't surprised to see some placeholders or buggy content. I'm not worried about that because I bought this game to be part of its evolution!  There's a lot to love here! I'm a very story and character driven player. I was immediately drawn to Robin's character design and personality and the initial premise of working for your grandmother by cleaning out the spirit world works for me. I am charmed by the supporting characters as well. Will there be romance?! You know we have to ask...  Gameplay wise, I usually play turn based roguelikes so I was nervous the game would be too hard. There are systems that I don't totally understand after an hour playing, but with the journal and loom progression I see how I can unlock improvements. I could also tell I was already getting better after several runs! Yes, it's a challenging game, but because I'm drawn into the story I'm compelled to keep at it!  Would recommend for those who love Hades-like gameplay and want a different twist, or those willing to play a challenging rogue-like in an interesting world. Plus the music is chill, the art is great and you get to pet many pups.",1
138070162,1582380,"if hades is boards of canada (as in the elusive hip hop duo, not the, uh, national boards of canada*), then midautumn is black moth super rainbow; something scrappier and lighter on its feet, with a super weird wrinkle (the core mechanic of this thing is wild. you're basically like playing a nuclear game of hot potato at all times) and lots of potential for where it can go from here.  *and hades isn't really that, but please work with me for the conceit of this review",1
138069893,1582380,"So I don't like to leave negative reviews for games normally but I think this is important since what is displayed in the trailer doesn't really match what you get (my gameplay time bugged out, I played for about 30 mintues). This game raised $40k on Kickstarter and then launched here 2 years later for early access, this is a day 1 review. ESPECIALLY do not buy this game for the full price of $25.  First and foremost, it currently doesn't have controller support really. It works vaguely but not enough and you need to use your mouse some times. The game also warns you on boot up that the save system is untested? I didn't actually have issues but launching a game that doesn't support controllers and may not save properly is unacceptable.  Another big thing that may not seem big is that the font for the text is not what you see in the trailer: in game it's chunky and totally unfitting (size 14 Arial or something). The text bubbles and UI in general is just very out of place. Speaking of which, the music is very bland in comparison to what you hear in the trailer.  The portrait character art is quite nice but a lot of the pixel art blends together and once combat starts everything is indistinguishable. It's hard to make out anything that is happening.  So the combat is just very bland. You collect an orb which allows you to shoot your staff at enemies. Some times the enemies throw the orbs. If you collect too many orbs at once, it hurts you instead. Bottomline: it wasn't very fun since you're limited to how many times you can attack and you spend a lot of time waiting around.  There were some small glimmers of hope when you see some upgrade systems (i.e. boons and shops) but it really wasn't enough. Overall the whole experience was bizarre and I am thoroughly confused as to how and why they would launch a game of this poor quality after a $40k Kickstarter and 2 years of development. And charge $25 for it no less.",0
121662824,1906800,"Awesome little souls-like pixel art game, developer listens to the community and is working super hard to bring new features and content.   Combat is tough, and your character requires light sources to avoid debuffs and eventually damage, so lighting braziers and bonfires is a must.

115799034,1906800,"[hr][/hr]      I had received this when the developer was trying to get the word out on the game and advertised a few keys for free. I immediately responded with: [list] [*]Me: ""Slimes, treasures, and bullets. I will gladly take a key, please.""  [*]Dev: ""[spoiler] [strike] Key [/strike] [/spoiler] have fun destroying those slimes!"" [*]Me: ""Thank you kind noble!"" [*]Dev: ""Also, if you want to join the game's Discord to get the inside scoop: [u][strike] Outdated Link [/strike][/u]"" [hr][/hr]       I happened to be in a streamer/content creators Discord when he advertised. Popping in there was not very common for me during this time of day. Right place, right time, and very glad.       I had initially missed the 3 Dimensional aspects built into this game. When the Dev posted the trailer advertising the game, it was only very obviously in the game in the first 5 seconds of the initial trailer.      Upon entering the Discord I was immediately greeted by the Developer and a member of the group. There was only around 17 people total at the time I joined.  [hr][/hr]       The Dev is very responsive and present, is willing to take ideas but will keep to his vision, and is a one man team currently. It is quite impressive what he has accomplished so far, and I can't wait to see where it goes.       The Dev set up a stream within Discord where he answered questions while playing the game. It was very evident, his attention to detail and diligence. You could also hear his excitement in his project. It isn't work to him. He is making time, when available in his busy life, to make this. There was also a very clear understanding of the gaming culture that he has experienced in his life, and his wanting to bring this into his game. He went into some video game history while explaining some of the influences in the game. He also explained most of the time so far was creating the engine, but now he can have more fun with his time where he can implement more.       Upon suggestions of the group, he has added some features and fixed a couple of things the community has asked for.   [hr][/hr]      Since my joining of the Discord, in the span of 15 days, the Dev has been regularly updating the game.       Upon my suggestion of a new trailer to show off the camera, and fixing of the camera, and other things, I had gotten a response within 2 hours, and the Dev had gotten updates out not long after.       In the quotes of the Dev and dates with updates.  [olist] [*]   05/07/2022 Glad you've enjoyed the game! Pretty much everything you mentioned is in the works.

[*]   05/07/2022 At the moment, there is a lot of content and features that aren't at the beginning of the game, most people who are only playing the first 30 mins won't get to see most of the game.

114625542,1906800,"Great game, it will provide a challenge but it is an amazing game and definitely worth a try!",1
114311371,1906800,"Have only played a few hours so far but I wanted to leave a review already because this game has really surprised me with how good it is.  It is being made by only one developer but everything seems well done and thought out, I can tell this is definitely a labour of love project.  [b] Graphics - [/b] while I'm not always a fan of voxel graphics I am a fan of pixel art and I actually think this game looks really good and does a good job of combining both, it's especially cool that you can rotate the camera fully 360 everywhere and look at everything from different angles  [b] Sound - [/b] I feel like this is something a lot of games (especially indie games) fall short on as it's not prioritised, but I was pleasantly surprised. Everything so far has sounded good, weapon hits, magic casting, pots breaking, etc. even that satisfying clink when picking up coins that I love when games get right. I've only fought one boss so far, but it had some pretty good fight music there, too  [b] Story - [/b] I haven't gotten far so I can't go too in depth but it seems good so far, it's playing out like a Zelda style save the world from the evil king but told in a souls-like fairly vague fashion, through signs, short dialogue and lore, I'll try and update this later when I get to see more of it.  [b] World / exploration - [/b] it's great! As I mentioned earlier everything looks nice, and there's plenty to find off the beaten path, hidden chests, paths, dungeons, diggable spots etc. this is where the rotatable camera really comes into play, too, as certain things aren't visible from different angles, hidden behind walls or under leaves and stuff. There's also already been a lot of interesting variation in the biomes and enemy design in what I've explored so far.  [b] General gameplay features - [/b] for one developer and EA it's got many of things you'd expect in a Zelda-like or Souls-like, and it keeps surprising me. There are stats, different weapons that scale on them, consumables, crafting/upgrading, even a limited ""farming"" that can get you extra coins. There are some pretty interesting things you wouldn't expect, too, like having the ability to place your own respawn (bonfire/grace) spots through consumable items.  [b] Combat - [/b] it's actually fairly in depth and has been enjoyable so far, it has blocking, dodges, poise, parrying, hits feel weighty and have impact, melee, magic & ranged. It's definitely not easy but hasn't felt unfair.  [b] Dev - [/b] as I said earlier the game is being made by only one guy, I've had the pleasure of talking to him on the discord and he's friendly and has seemed very willing to listen to suggestions and feedback, I mentioned a couple things to him on the day of an update and they were actually changed / fixed in that same update that came out an hour or so later.  [b] Cons - [/b] I haven't found much to complain about, but as with most EA games not everything is fully there yet, my biggest issue so far is the lack of settings and not having the ability to remap keybinds yet, but I've been told that's all planned, so if you're willing to wait a little it's not even an issue.  Overall I've been really surprised with how much content that's here and I've been having a blast.  Also I just wanted to note that while I happened to receive a free copy of the game after meeting the developer on a discord server, I'm going to be purchasing a copy of the game (will give to a friend or something) to support the game. It's definitely a steal at this price.",1

Still filled with technical issues like the screen resetting to be small every time you die, picking things up felt better, but when you walk. you slowly go to the right for some reason. Gameplay was fine except for the fuckin Mr Kabob Man/Ophilia Bird part. That was horrendous! Jumping onto the bird felt broken as it would still kill you sometimes while giving you the sound that you completed it and having to run back, grab the hats, and move Kabob all over again was mind-numbing.

138071445,2311190,"Garten of Banban 3 is an absolute gem of a game that exceeded all my expectations.

One of the standout features of the game is the rich and compelling storyline. The narrative is beautifully crafted, filled with twists, turns, and memorable characters. It kept me hooked from start to finish, and I found myself emotionally invested in the fate of the game's protagonists.  The soundtrack of Garten of Banban 3 is a masterpiece in itself.

The level design is truly remarkable. Each location is meticulously crafted, offering a sense of wonder and discovery around every corner. The attention to detail is commendable, and it's clear that the developers poured their hearts into creating a world that players would want to explore.  Garten of Banban 3 also excels in its character development. The main characters are well fleshed out, with their own distinct personalities and motivations. I felt a genuine connection with them and rooted for their success throughout the game.  The game strikes a perfect balance between open-world exploration and a linear narrative. There's a sense of freedom to explore at your own pace while still being guided by a captivating story. This balance kept me engaged and ensured I never felt overwhelmed or lost.

Resulta que este videojuego tiene varias maneras de enfrentarse a la disonancia ludonarrativa, manteniendo una suave y delicada línea entre las cinematicas y la jugabilidad, siendo esta vuelta previamente mencionada, el eje principal de la historia. Muy equiparable a lo que hizo Hideo Kojima con Metal Gear Solid 2, ya que involucra un personaje que es deleznable al comienzo, pero que con el paso de la narrativa, empiezas a comprender sus motivaciones.

It takes seconds to get into the game and hours to get back out of it! The game is so well designed you don't get tired of playing it. In survival mode the music continuously changes so inevitably when you start over again and again and again you don't hear the same song starting at the same point every time. There's nothing about this game that will annoy you except your own performance. And that's what keeps you playing. You've got to do better. You can do better. You MUST do better!  Amazingly I find myself just as addicted when watching other people play it on Twitch. It's all the fun of playing it but none of the frustration of your own mistakes.

138073642,1940340,"Darkest Dungeon 2 is a different vision for a sequel for the first game, but that doesn't stop it from being a very good experience.  Darkest Dungeon 2 is more focused on being a more ""proper"" rogue-like. You have individual runs in which you choose up to 4 party members of various classes with you and if one die they get randomly replaced by any of the classes you unlocked while playing. If your entire party dies.... The run ends... but you're not left with almost nothing unlike the first game. You're left with currency to unlock brand new never before scene characters, trinkets, upgrades for existing characters and more.   I believe this is a more healthy gameplay loop that allows more time playing the game instead of playing ""catch-up"" like in the first game. No longer do you need to re-grind out certain characters or classes so you can finally get back to where you once were. No longer do you need to juggle multiple parties and micro-manage how your traumatized characters are gonna be healthy enough for the next dungeon.   Overall Darkest Dungeon 2 is a very nice improvement to the Darkest Dungeon formula. There's much to look at even outside of a gameplay perspective. The new animations and 3D models bring enemies and characters to life to further improve the immersion.   Darkest Dungeon 2 isn't as bad as people online made it out to be. Please give it a chance or call me stupid :)  Have fun adventurers!~",1

I personally prefer the removal of the micro-managed army of characters and the addition of roguelite mechanics. I like the (big) bite-sized runs and don't feel as destroyed when a run fails. The game is still very challenging and you will suffer, but you'll suffer just enough that you want to play again instead of turning the game off for a few months to mentally recover from 12 hours of lost progress. They also improved on a lot of the gameplay and visuals from the original which I'm loving so far!  Unfortunately the original hardcore fans probably wont enjoy this game but if you were a more casual fan or a first timer, this might just pull you in!",1

Particularly galling when one of those bugs causes every clicked item in an inn to be instantly and irrevocably sold from your inventory (and yes, I confirmed this was not an issue with my keyboard). That's pretty much a run-ending bug right there.  Aside from bugs, it's a fun Darkest Dungeon inspired roguelike that doesn't really feel like a sequel to Darkest Dungeon. It's much harder to get invested in the characters when you're resetting everything every couple of hours. It's not a bad game by any means, but I'd wait for a sale before purchasing.",0

At its current sale price of $8.70 (regularly $13), A Day Out! presents excellent value for money, especially considering its potential for future improvements. During my playthrough, I had an absolute blast with a friend, diving into the immersive world of mysterious creatures and heart-pounding encounters.  While the game shows promise, it does suffer from a few bugs and occasional glitches. However, it's important to note that the developers are actively working on addressing these issues, which bodes well for the game's future stability and overall polish.  One minor downside is the prolonged downtime when a character is downed, as it takes a bit longer than desired to get back up. Nonetheless, this issue doesn't overshadow the overall enjoyment of the game, especially when playing with friends. The cooperative gameplay elements shine, and the jumpscares peppered throughout the missions add an extra layer of excitement and intensity.  Currently, A Day Out! offers four engaging missions that provide a solid gameplay experience. These missions showcase the game's potential and provide a glimpse into what the developers have in store for future updates. With their commitment to expanding the game, players can look forward to more content and exciting challenges down the line.  In conclusion, I would highly recommend A Day Out! to fans of both Grounded and Bigfoot, as well as anyone seeking a fun and thrilling gaming experience with friends.

138073630,1347310,"""Spider-man with guns!"" This page throws that at you a lot. If swarm is anything, ""Spider-man with guns"" is not one of them. Swarm has you swinging around tiny arenas with shark filled water beneath you, as you careen helplessly through the air with little to no control over direction, speed, or positioning.   If you fall too low you die to the aforementioned sharks. That's fair. But the inertia of your swing can slam you into the water, and you still also die. While still connected to a platform. You can make a big, slow hand motion to equally slowly shorten your tether, but if you're moving too fast then you're just screwed.  My initial instinct after hearing their Spider-man comparison was to tug myself in a direction to make a quick, direct maneuver in the direction i wished to travel. This is not possible. You are purely, solely, at the mercy of gravity. While you do unlock an ability called ""Zip"" This ability only shoots you into a platform you are already facing, and rarely far enough to feel impactful.  Performance-wise, the game runs fine with the exception of 1 small and 1 game breaking bug I encountered. While in the tutorial I lost all audio from the game, and no amount of settings adjusting could fix it. When I tried to quit the game it booted me to the main menu instead, where the sound came back. But, after unlocking the ""Zip"" feature, the feature itself would not work in its own tutorial, and the pause menu would not open at all, causing to me force close the game. At that point I saw no purpose to go through the boot up process, and simply uninstalled and refunded.   If the devs make changes to the movement mechanics I will give it another attempt, but for now I recommend against playing this game.",0
138075225,1269300,"Overview: If you can get a group of 2-4 together, it's definitely a fun game and worth the $20 price tag.  Pros: 1. Chaos - the game is chaotic as your ship is being bombarded by enemy fire, you're trying to reload your friend's gun but you have to audible to repair a wall that's been breached and spaced your other friend. 2. Straightforward mechanics - The game just makes sense.  Put ammo in gun to shoot, grab repair kit to repair.  The tutorial is a bit lacking, but playing 2-3 times is sufficient to get the hang of it. 3. Difficulty - We're about 4-5 runs in and unable to get past the 3rd (out of 4) sector on normal difficulty.  There's a difficulty spike in the 3rd sector that we haven't figured out how to overcome, and that's fun.  Cons: 1. Variety - there's only two ships.  I think there's additional challenges for each ship (we haven't even won yet), but I'd expect more ships in a space game like this.  Also, there don't seem to be that many gun options (maybe 10 total, we haven't unlocked them all yet but it feels limited). 2. Balance - there's a lot of content that is blatantly inferior.  We've passed on offensive weapons because we felt the default starter weapons were stronger.  Summary: While there's a bit lacking in terms of content and balance, it's still a really fun game with a group of friends and I think it's fairly priced for what you get.",1

I lived all my years in that ancient, rumor shadowed manor, fattened by decadence and luxury - and yet I began to tire of conventional extravagance. Singular, unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway to some fabulous and unnameable power. With relic and ritual I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on swarthy workmen and sturdy shovels.  At last in the salt soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth but we were in a realm of death and madness. In the end I alone fled laughing and wailing through those blackened arcades of antiquity until consciousness failed me.  You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial. It is a festering abomination! I beg you. Return home; claim your birthright, and deliver our family from the ravenous, clutching shadows of the Darkest Dungeon.",1

138075223,1940340,"I think the biggest flaw with changing to the rougelike formula is the lack of variety. The journey has minor randomization but no true game-changing happenstance.   You run chapter 1 over and over till you beat it, following the same regions and the same enemies. You beat the boss, HOORAY! right? But now you move on to chapter two, following the same steps along a different path and your journey always ends in the same place, with the only true difference being the chapter boss.   Once you have unlocked all hero skills, the only real changes to gameplay is either what your starting squad is or who replaced a death in the party. I haven't reached the ends of the final chapters but so far there has been no real advancement, constantly fighting the same enemies with the same level 0 heroes till you can reach an inn to level up your skills once.   Frankly, the bonuses of trinkets even when mixed into the path system just does not provide the variety I expect from a rougelike designed to be replayed constantly",0

I have been waiting for this game to drop on steam for some time and so far it has exceeded my expectations.  Some people are complaining about the linear research path to get better stuff. Not once did i feel this hindered my gameplay experience. Almost everything you research you will want to immediately use/build and the progression seems balanced.  My advice; take your time and loot everything! The looting CAN feel grindy in single player, especially if you leave nothing behind like me, but after you get the grappling hook it gets way easier.  Other complaints about multiplayer bugs and headbobbing are already being addressed by the developer day 1 of release which is nice to see. I have great hopes for the continued development of this title.   Kudos to the dev for making an awesome game!",1

138074870,1159690,"It's shitty Raft but a train. It's early access (at the moment) sure, but it's design tenets revolve around being tedious and slow. You get resources picking stuff off the train, which means the train has to keep a relatively slow pace despite all the upgrades towards that. You also don't get a lot of influence in what you get, so it's a lot of tiddling your thumbs until you get enough of whatever to shove into the research bench to continue along. Except you are gatekeeped not only by research tiers, which is fine, but also story beats that require you to make those things, which forces you to make stuff you... don't need, at all. Plus there's a shark and mines on the railway and stuff, but you have a pistol with unlimited ammo so it's just a mild attention tax while you collect resources and further encourages you to go slow. There is plenty of early access jank, too, but the design set up is simply not an entertaining experience.",0
138074861,1159690,"If you like Raft you'll like this. If you hate games that you spend most of the time gathering resources then don't play it you'll only complain and give it a bad review because you don't like gathering games. the game is less then 12 hours old, and honestly has less bugs and issues then I've seen EVERY TRIPLE A GAME have in the last few years. Yes there's some things i want different like the way you research, but the game is good.",1
138074826,1159690,"TL;DR The concept is great, but the gameplay feels tiresome rather than fun and doesn't feeling like you're achieving anything or progressing. I realise this is EA and I hope they smooth out the game play and make it feel like you're getting somewhere, but at this point I'm not optimistic with how little difference there is between the first 3 levels I've played so far and the demo which was around for ages.  Here's some of the specifics that made the game play just unpleasant: Inventory management, resource gathering, crafting and combat are all clunky and tiresome. The ""quests"" seem to be more like badly done tutorial steps and don't really align with available resources i.e. you get quests that you have no resources for. One of the quests is to build a ""garden"", which is then useless because you don't have the dependency required to grow any plants (looks like some sort of blueprint is required, but you don't get told anything about it). Resources aren't properly explained. If you're unlucky on RNG you won't even realise that leather comes from the little sea slug things and there are long periods, at least in the second level, where they just aren't there for much of the level. For a game that gives such limited resources, you'd think they'd have an inventory and storage system that lets you store what little is available. The crafting process is incredibly tiresome with a clunky interface and then forces you to make multiple dependencies on different machines (many of which require fuel) before you can craft something useful. There's also no parts list so you have to remember all the requirements for each dependency as well as the final product. Luckily I've only had a dependency chain 3 deep so far, I shudder to think that it will get worse. As to the fuel, once again, limited resources but wood burns through so quickly that you're constantly having to ride at minimum speed to ensure you don't miss any and reverse if you did. The next step ""up"", charcoal, costs fuel to make and doesn't seem to be much better than using plain wood. This is a symptom of a general imbalance in resource availability, usage and crafting requirements. Combat is tiresome and janky. Enemies seem to know you're there as soon as you arrive at a station. They appear to move faster and shoot faster than you and, in the little I've seen, heavily outnumber you. Essentially you stand around trying to take shots at them and losing health until you get a lucky shot or 10 through to kill one. They hide behind objects, but there's no cover mechanic in the game so you just have to go in the open to get shot while trying to return fire. You get loads of ammo though, for weapons you don't have and there is no sign of them being available any time soon.",0
138074822,1159690,It ok but man this has some epic shenanigans. To many issue when Epic involved. Dev need to start reclaiming their feature back as it creating issue how it perform.,0

138075454,1582380,"One of the worst written, buggiest games I’ve ever seen: you are currently unable to access your save game. This isn’t worth $25: this is easily a $5 Android game. Actually…that’s an insult to $5 Android games: this should have been free for how awful it is.  When I began Midautumn, I had high expectations. The first WELCOME screen tells you that “Saving is also untested.” Un…untested? A boring exposition dump began right off the bat, so I hit the spacebar to skip the VERY slow reading of the cringecore dialogue. This was a tragic mistake.  This brought up the “choose your save slot” menu. I clicked, and to my surprise ANOTHER audio track of the narrator being boring activated. Tried it again, got three going at once. This rules. I assume the game skipped the entire intro because there suddenly was a random character telling me about a cursed place. No transition or explanation: just spewing line after line of garbage. Then a character (the main character?) says she’s a guardian or something. And she had purple skin? This wasn’t in media res: this was a disaster.  A character barks at me “THE LUNAR STONE PROVIDES BLOOD FOR EVERY BEING IN THIS REALM. IT IS THE HEART, AND ALL OF US ARE MERELY ITS CAPILLARIES.” Unlocked the journal, it immediately opens to EXACTLY the same text. Was this so important it needed a copy/paste? Text at the bottom of the journal tells me that I’ll “Learn more by discovering more of the story.” That’s only 3/5 written?  I decide to set the enemy damage to 0% and enemy health to 0%. Why suffer through this stuttering combat more than I need to? The game then stuck me in an unskippable tutorial room…I tried desperately to make the “Debt-blows” (DO YOU GET IT? JUST LIKE THAT SAINTS ROW GAME FELLOW STUDENT) and nothing works. I hit escape to reload…the exit to menu button doesn’t work. I have to use task manager to exit the game and relaunch it…The save file is still there! But when I click on it…it takes me back to the main menu. Restarting the game: same issue. I can’t open my save file of an hour anymore. The menu music is getting VERY annoying at this point, so I turn off the music, run an errand, and come back. On relaunching the game: NONE of my options saved…despite the game telling me, with every menu adjustment, that it was saving. My windowed preference was thrown out for full screen, with the music blaring and a static image on the main menu.   This game has been in development for 3 years and raised $40,140. Where did all the money go? I’m running an advanced laptop and…what’s this? It’s overheating? This laptop is less than a year old how…oh….Midautumn decided to spill Boba Tea on optimization efforts. At least there’s the Send Feedback button…oh wait…It opens a browser URL and asks me to fill in..Email and a bunch of fields in Google Forms? I’d be great for the developer to put a contact on the Steam page…but I need to go to their website and hunt for an email address? Even the discussion forums have people begging to contact the developer.  Writing: easily the worst part of the game. Thank goodness you can only talk to NPC’s once in the overworld! They get much more annoying as the game progresses, but the story is bland and the characters hyper exaggerated caricatures. That’s because they’re self inserts for the main writer (Robin) and the Potion guy (main developer). The writing and plot beats are so ham fisted as well: it goes from tedious exposition dumps to MYSTERIOUS musings that nobody besides the development team would find interesting. After a few hours: the game just ends. No satisfying resolution to any of this but you can easily tell where it’s going. What’s most disappointing is that the game advertised commentary on gentrification and Asian diaspora…But here, those are so poorly written it doesn’t feel earned, intelligent, or real. Everyone is trying to be a comedian but the audience isn’t laughing: every “zinger” falls flat. Like Hades: the game tries to use character portraits to lure you in, but unlike Hades, none of the characters are charming, engaging, or fun to talk to. There’s no relationship mechanic either: you’re just whining while everyone talks at you. As a ripoff of Hades, it’s baffling the author didn’t pick up on any of the things people love about Hades.  For a good idea of the Tumblr-esque dialogue…Robin: “Welp. It was worth a shot.” How poggers!. “Bye room. I’ll be back” sounds as cringe spoken aloud as it is written.   Visuals: the pixel art in the overworld is nice. If only the same could be said of the dungeons: so chaotic in the art design, it looks like one of the purple ghosts threw up purple on everything. It hurts the eyes after a few minutes: the attacks you do at times look like a dong, but that’s the only positive part of the combat. Creepy developer too: I wanted to check out the developers and game on Twitter and discovered…I was blocked. By every member of Team Midautumn. I had never tweeted about Midautumn or engaged with any of their tweets, so I had to do some digging. I had a mild criticism about the main writer (who writes for Kotaku) and the main developer Sherveen was name searching negative comments on twitter to preemptively block them. For each team member. I had a friend say something negative about an article a few months later and surprise surprise: Sherveen had blocked them on every account as well. Not sure if he’s doing this daily, but that is thin skinned and PATHETIC.  Midautumn is a tedious, boring, Hades-clone with cringe writing and unlikeable characters.  This should have been a tech demo and self-insert fanfic: save your money and time.",0

138076228,1742020,"Smooth gameplay and well thought out mechanics. Don't need to be a Hololive fan to enjoy this game.   Single player modes may frustrate beginners as there are no difficulty settings and you have to start over when you lose one match. However, the game's current form as of this review is still in it's early form with obvious future updates to come.",1
138075815,1742020,"Can't really say no to a free fighter with Hololive in it.  I certainly can't say no when the devs took the time under pressure during the Calli v. Watame stream to fix connectivity issues due to issues with invites live and patch it out in a very short time.  It was a similar issue that I was having with a friend in another country and we both assumed it would never be fixed and it would more than likely just be a wash and we'd never come back.  Imagine my surprise when it was fixed the same day.  By that alone, it gets my recommendation.  Is it a perfect fighter?  No.  Does it have room to grow?  Absolutely.  But you can tell that the devs actually care and it's rare to see that, especially on something without a price tag.",1
138076267,1557990,"I really really want to like this game but the mechanics feel so stiff and unnatural that it physically hurts. Crafting, and combat are really cool but crafting is a pain because everything in the map gives wood or nothing and its very difficult to find items. ranged weapons are also strange, they are cool crafted, DIY weapons but its a pain to find ammo or make it, just like most craftables, and many of them are innacurate or just bad. if the movement and combat actually had flow and wasnt so damn stiff, i would love this game. please, just make it more natural feeling.",1
138076979,2055910,"sure, with a name like poosh, you think you're safe. you think, ""i can control myself. this won't take total control of my life or my destiny."" but then after 2 rounds (maybe less), the neon poosh grabs you and never lets go. you become feral. your maslow hierarchy of needs completely shift and poosh is all-encompassing. you become.. a poosh hound, if you will. all you can think about is, ""when can i poosh again?"" or even worse ""will i ever get to poosh again?"" layer that with synth sounds made by someone i can only assume is very handsome- you too think you can be very handsome. very handsome at the top of the leaderboards...if..if only just for a moment.",1

138077488,1940340,Everything fun about the original is gone and hasn't been replaced with anything of substance. A watered down bland experience coming from the first game.,0
138077392,1940340,"I didn't mind the style changes and I still enjoyed the combat for a good bit. The change too room reward system also didn't really feel that much different.   The simple reason I would say to stay away is this game wastes your time. I, of course, don't mean it a time waster like all hobbies can be. Just long long stretches of nothing. Want to start a run? You start then have to move your carriage forward, stop, work your currency shop, move forward for a few seconds, stop at the crosswords, spamming space cuts the scene but you still have to wait for the voice lines it's like this more often than not so more empty time, Skills aren't saved so each run you now have to grab the skills you like  each time. Don't forget check the perks on a different page, the paths on a different page, Ready? Nope walk forward, load tutorial zone EVERY TIME, do the single basic fight every time, travel again. It takes 8-16s each time you travel just watching this carriage. You can't even zone out as you must hit the same two to each map textures to get things. By default you have to hold forward the hold time or you just stop. I do not say this for sensationalism, but a third of my time was just holding forward or waiting for the game to finish with it's voice lines. You can never get RIGHT back into another run.  The biggest sin for me though is it lie's to you. Use candles to unlock new classes you can get the tutorial for this and a note in game. EXCEPT, They are gated beyond Inn progress points. So if you are like me and unlocked anything other than hellion at the start Too bad you just added more runs to get going.   So TLDR. Probably a good time once the fast forward feature gets added. Maybe prevent duplicate negatives as well, double pacifism and double soft feel kinda brutal.  Otherwise I will admit the surface layer, voice, and art style are on brand let's say.",0

138076145,1730250,"It's pan'orific!  The TL;DR is that Dorfromantik is still the superior game in this genre. An analogy that comes to mind be comparing regular LEGO blocks with DUPLO blocks. Dorfromantik would be your LEGOs and Pan'orama would be your DUPLO blocks.  Okay, maybe a bit harsh in comparison. Pan'orama is enoyable but I can't help but feel like it's missing something. Or maybe I expected more than I should have? The 3D aspect is cool. I like the big chunky buildings / landmarks when they appear. The multi-tile options that come up are a nice addition to this type of game. Being able rotate the multi-tile sets and slide it into position for a bunch of points is great. The animals were a little disappointing in that you press spacebar and they're all highlighted. I was expecting more of a challenge to find them and maybe bigger reward? There's no tile rotation for single tiles, so you're stuck with the facing of the tile. The menu options are minimal. When you run out of tiles and the game is over, it feels so anti-climatic. Could win an award for the dullest end of game screen.  If you're looking for a casual tile laying / city builder give it a shot. If there's only room for one of these in your library, I would have to recommend Dorfromantik.",1

Now although I'm Loving this game i do have to point out a few things that needs work but I'm sure will be addressed. 1. the enemies will see you and start attacking like ****** out chimps.  there is no sneaking up and getting the first shot and there aim is pretty sniperish lol 2. tutorial is really just telling you what to build next, not really explaining where to get certain items and such. 3.  you get weapon upgrades before your even told how to swap them or whats needed",1

If you're looking for a game that you can unlock everything within an hour, this isn't the game for you. If you like games like Raft, The Forest, or No Mans Sky, you will love this game. If you are looking for a Call of Duty FPS clone, looks somewhere else.",1

Found for me its a good way to unwind after work cause I can go at my own pace, combat does level a bit to be desired in terms of you VS NPC's but I do like the weapon customization. This is all coming of course from someone who plays alone. I do really enjoy the humor the game is going for with the Narrator, gives me Stanley parable vibes. But I would recommend it personally.",1

Some small bugs, sure, but overall it is a wonderful experience.  The people complaining of linearity can go play Ark or something.  - This is a truly cinematic experience that is more than playable.   - I do not find it tedious - Co-op worked great - Visually stunning - Very little frame drop, even on Ultra settings.  I have a 1660 Super. - Crafting system is a little restrictive, but it is for your own good.  It is TEACHING YOU TO PLAY THE GAME. Give it a try.",1

This game will grab you and pull you into it's dramatic story line quickly and have you clenching your back cheeks you sit on as you traverse through a giant variety of enemies.  You'll die often but never lose more than a minute or two of progress and this will keep you trucking onward to save the princess and solve the mystery of who captured her, where she is being held captive, and why.    I love it.  And chances are that if you're reading this review that you will too!  You have two hours and two weeks to refund it if you don't love it, so what are you waiting for?  RECOMMENDED!

Powered weapons run out of power way too fast, resources in pockets don't carry over on mission completions (not sure if that's a bug, but please do not do that, I would like to keep my guns.). Traps aren't exactly intuitive, took me a while to realize I had to rotate the mouse-trap, so maybe a holographic preview of how the trap activates with a basic tripwire setup would help clear that up (just make it playback when you're rotating the mouse-trap so you can see it in real-time before you do something you really didn't want to do.)  Overall, it's more tedious than fun. When it is fun, it's pretty fun. I duct-taped three knives together and essentially had a sword. Put a hatchet on a leveler. Duct-taped two hatchets and essentially had a dual-bladed quarterstaff. Put a screwdriver on a frying pan and stabbed heads.  The duct-taping gimmick is probably the only thing keeping me in.",0

Sure, you can keep grabbing new weapons, but that makes you use up fuel faster. Sure, you can play cautiously and not awaken too many enemies, but that means you won't get as much fuel. The latter was especially apparent when I came across the first boss monster-- it quickly became a balancing act between pulling enough other enemies to keep myself fueled while not getting surrounded and overwhelmed.  Overall, so far so good! Looking forward to seeing how this develops.",1

138078129,1742020,"Ok not going to lie,,,for a free to play unofficial fan-made game...you can tell that the creators put more focus on casual gameplay than competitive or in this case pvp. To be honest really i'm kinda glad this is a fighting game meant for casuals. Cause from playing this game it feels like it's main purpose is to appeal to people who actually complain about a game that isn't your standard Tekken or Street Fighter and not getting molly walloped online in ranked. To me it feels like it's a multiplayer fighter that appeals to single player casuals without the aspects of competitive in mind. Is it a bad game? Well...it's 50-50. It's a fun game but at the same time a game with a lot of....kinks needing to be worked on. I'll put pros and cons:  Pros: Good graphics, controls are spot on, easy to learn commands, pulling of combos is awesome, cute girls characters who can dish out damage.  Cons: the game feels hella stiff and kinda slow especially with movement of characters (though this could be a thing with me and not overall), THERE IS HELLA SLOWDOWN WITH INPUTTING COMBOS (and what I mean by that is the FPS be dropping like mad), I feel like trying to do commands while during combo don't register much especially when trying to string in a Super, roster is lacking in characters, online in beta (just...why?).  Game Rating? 5.75/10. It's a free to play title which is cool and needs to get stuff worked on. Support is greatly needed. all in all I don't mind playing this game on the casuals side.",1

138078440,1940340,"Just as despair inducing as the first game, but with more replayability and team theorycrafting. Some people are dissatisfied by the gameplay differences between DD1/DD2, but at the end of the day they are different games. Just because it's titled Darkest Dungeon 2, does not mean it should be a copy paste of Darkest Dungeon 1 with tweaks to the story/levels/QOL, and nor do I think people should be happy if they were to receive that (Especially since mods like the Black Reliquary exist).   IMO, what made DD1 fantastic was how attached you would feel to the heros you develop and take into harder and harder  dungeons (moreso if you name them) and in turn how heartbreaking it was to see them fail that death door check, or how invigorating it was to see them overcome stress by becoming virtuous. DD2's value is that it is expansive on the first game, and not just a clone. It flourishes off the environment that the first game created-- the enemies are scarier, the bosses are so much more intriguing, and the world beyond the hamlet has become so much more catastrophic. The game has so much more story to tell about the heroes' pasts, and the fact that its so replayable means that you have more freedom to experiement with heroes in different positions, with different abilities, and now with different paths to further vary their capabilities, all without harboring the fear of permanently losing a character that you invested time, effort, money, and levels into.  If you haven't tried the game and you're getting cold feet due to some reviews going ""I loved DD1 but this game wasn't it for me"" , try it first especially if you played DD1, and then decide for yourself if you liked it or not.  If you tried it and you're upset it didn't hit the spot the same way the first game did, then play Darkest Dungeon 1. Whether you liked DD2 or not, it won't change that how much of a masterpiece Darkest Dungeon 1 is.",1

First of all the game is pretty short (Since there is really only one level and a slightly changed version of it after defeating it the first time) but it is a cheap game so that's okay with me and even so its still fun to play! It can be a bit challenging at the start but after a few tries and learning the game/enemies its certainly doable.

Cant even store a rifle in them. - Stuff disappearing and or falling through the floor when we killed enemies. - 3rd Person would be cool, not everyone likes playing first person all the time.  - Crafting benches require way to many clicks to accomplish anything.

Having played only a few hours, but intend to keep going and probably update this review as I go.   So far, one big complaint of mine has to do with how you cannot ""save and exit""/there is no checkpoint mechanic. You really should be able to save and exit at each inn, especially before the mountain area! Don't feel like truckin' on because you are tired, have a family, got work to do, other hobbies, better things to do? (unlike me) - well tough luck! Give up it is and restart later! Now you do get resources (extra for reaching said inns) but it takes about 3 hours to make it all the way to the mountain area and fight the boss.  Other than that?

Very good system red hook...  - The narrator :- in DD1 the narrator quotes n voiceline was enough to sell u the game, even the intro for DD1 was 10/10 but in this,theres the narrator guy but none of the lines feel...powerful as DD1, its just a shame really  - Affliction :- My heroes got max stressed, most of the time they got a meltdown but they never got a debuff where theyd either keep hurling insults at themselves or others,pass their turns and such.I just couldnt be bothered to play this game more but im pretty sure the afflictions are gone aswell,which is another damn shame  Save ur money,wait for mod support/steamworkshop",0
138079744,1940340,"The cart mechanics are very unsatisfying. There's no attachment to the characters; there's no building a character up, fine tuning their quarks, building up your equipment, etc. Instead it's just roguelite mechanics, unlocking more powerful things to use on your next run, and getting fresh characters every time. A lot of the tension and intensity from the previous game is lost, which I feel like it's what the game was mostly known for. Though, the animation is a great improvement, this just makes me want to go play DD1.",0
138079738,1940340,"I cried the first time i loaded this game up, Darkest Dungeon is one of the greatest games i have ever had the pleasure of even buying. Starting as a kick starter project years ago it has built its way up onto the home page of Steam, this game and its first are such a legendary depiction of a slight spin on the Lovecraft horror wrote in H.P Lovecraft's books. I see only 2 problems in this game and that is what feels like very back back line damage. This game unlike its first is mostly about shuffling and shifting your party but can be avoided if done properly, however even with good parties i feel like no matter who i bring the back line is still able to bring a hard time on my party especially the cadaver enemies in the Tangle and the Lair boss for the Farmland. My other problem is mainly the halved options as from the first game, i love and understand it as their are so many characters that need their shrine stories written plus the 3 extra attacks, unique memories and trinkets that need to be added in place. I am just hoping in the future Red hook make the choice of adding the greatest Duo since Jim and Dwight from the office, Dismas and Reynauld back to the game since they are such an iconic pair and i love my Crusader.

138079463,1940340,"The good: - Relationship system has a meaningful impact on replayability - Animations are very pretty and satisfying to look at - Character paths add a whole new dimension to composing your party - love it - Combat items can be a very strong booster for fresh game/experienced player and help sidestep the ""metaprogression is how you play the game"" issue - Micromanaging is for the most part gone - Character unique ""stories"" are very nice and engaging.  The bad: - Metaprogression is how you play the game. This goes even further than only unlocks: you get the items you've just unlocked with metacurrency at the start of your run. Full slot trinkets + full slot carriage items are a very strong boost. - Relationship system can really really ruin your run if you rely on a certain skill. It's idea is quite nice, implementation and balance leaves a lot to wish for. - A lot of the game is just waiting for the cart to sluggishly move forward in the same locations - Locations are very very very few, choices are non impactful. - Cart hp/wheel system can be just thrown out - it does not bring anything exciting to the game, just slows the tempo down. - Skill unlocks via their stories should be 100% switched with paths. It would make more narrative sense and actually let you play the character via unlocking the skill + the path instead of unlocking the path and wondering when you're going to get the appropriate skill.  The ugly: - Stress maxing out will usually just drain all your HP. The main selling point of DD is for some reason mutilated and watered down to ""risk of loosing all character HP"" instead of plethora of interactions with relationships/perks/paths. - The cart-on-the-road idea. It's ugly, its not fun, it doesn't make any sense, whoever pitched the ""yuuuh I KNOW WE'LL HAVE A CART AND THEY WILL HAVE TO REPAIR IT"" - please burn in hell. The worst game loop design ever - General UI/UX with a pinnacle at a gazillion of tokens WITH A CHEAT SHEET and actual usage of tokens in items - are you kidding? Not animations, not narration, not tutorial, but ICONS? - You don't keep your characters. A great deal of relationship/quirk/disease/memory/path/story systems are just made irrelevant. When I first killed the first boss I was really excited to see what happens to my heroes mid-run, how their relationships progress, what they learn and then I am presented with a new screen in the metaprogression shop and that's it  To sum up: casualized session-based DD1 with some fresh takes and cute animations, but a horribly boring game loop, metaprogression in the form of a shop and stale UI/UX. If you have time to play DD1 - skip this one and go play that. If you want some DD feeling for an hour after work - this can be your daily fix.",0

Easy 10/10 for me, the following are just 'hey these might be nice' notes.  My only complaint would be that the game seems to have gotten almost too easy in the full release, which i think is certainly a positive note for many who might play. Perhaps a slightly 'harder' mode that grants less tiles per unique building would do that? Also some further variation to each tile tier might also be nice. Having a row of identical lakes for water/other tiles is a bit immersion breaking.

138082325,1159690,"Gameplay loop is quite repetitive and boring. The first two hrs I spend nothing but collecting resources in my very limited area of the train. Very grindy. I constantly were short on wood, which is the only resource to power all devices you craft, at least at this stage of the game. I guess there will be other fuel sources later, but for the first two to three hrs its a frustrating experience.  There is no freedom or excitement to explore as in similar games like Raft, from which Voidtrain obviously borrowed from. But it clearly did not manage to capture the same vibe and exitement I had with games like Raft or Subnautica. You are stuck on a rail, literally, and all you do is collect resources floating by in a 10m radius, and the destination is predetermined. You have some beautiful backround object, such as floating islands, but they are just that: background images and you cant go there. I stopped playing the game after my second, forced, ""rail station"" stop, where I encountered some very poorly desigend AI enemies of 5 or 6 gentleman, all dressed alike, all acting the same stoic way and all getting constantly stuck in walls or facing me with their backs while I shot them within 10 seconds.  These stops felt empty and with barely any interaction. All they had were copy pasted loot boxes wit the same stuff you already collect from the void around the train and some additional ammo, for which I did not have any guns.  The game might get better at later stages, but if you can't capture your audience in the first 2 to 3 hrs of gameplay, then at least for me its a return.",0
138082017,1159690,"The progression in this game is pretty bad. Unlocking constructions for things you can't interact with before crafting ones you can interact with is kind of unfair. Why introduce a planter box if A) you can't place them on the shelves like you can with storage boxes and B) have any seeds to plant? The inventory at the moment needs some work. Upgraded storage boxes, maybe to hold up to 60 items should come before other constructions you unlock. The zinc spawns are quite crap. I cannot progress until I find at least 1 more piece of zinc. And then I would need to find even more to craft the blueprint I need to research. Also why is there so much ammunition but very little fire power? Can you swap ammunition types? Or are they for different weapons?  The lighting is also really annoying with how pitch black the game gets while on your train.  The lighting doesn't make much sense because the large looming object in front of you casts a shadow on your train but also you cast a shadow in the direction towards the large looming object. The game needs more lights. And also enemies despawning before you can loot their dropped things as well as not being able to cancel a reload to melee an enemy or pick up an item is really annoying.  I don't understand why there's so much organics and ice when I never lose hunger fast enough to need it. Cooking organics and refining ice into water is pointless.  You can't even trade them at vending machines for other resources.  The token drop rates are also quite crap. Can you make them a currency and not take up an inventory slot please? Or better yet automatically pick up instead of individually having to pick up a token.   I dunno. I'm just like waiting for something good to happen rather than the progression of unlocking blueprints being exactly that. The early game isn't slow it's just you hit a brick wall and stagnate.  Yeah, the game's got kinks but I didn't expect to have to deal with RNG roadblocks this early on.  I've only played about 6 hours.",1

138081385,1159690,"This one is a disappointing game that falls short on multiple fronts. My experience with the game has been overwhelmingly negative. First and foremost, I am deeply disappointed by the developers' decision to force Steam players to utilize the Epic Games service for gameplay. This unnecessary requirement is an inconvenience and disrupts the seamless gaming experience.  Furthermore, the game itself feels extremely unfinished and lacks engaging content. The gameplay mechanics are clunky and unintuitive, making it difficult to immerse oneself in the game world. The storyline is poorly executed, failing to captivate and hold my interest with it's tries to copy Stanley Parable.  To make matters worse, not all terms and elements within the game have been properly translated into English. This oversight adds confusion and detracts from the overall experience. It is evident that insufficient attention has been given to localization and quality assurance.  In summary, ""Voidtrain"" is a raw and unpolished game that fails to deliver an enjoyable gaming experience. The forced usage of the Epic Games service, combined with the lackluster gameplay and inadequate translation, further contribute to my disappointment. I would not recommend this game to others, as it falls short of expectations on multiple levels.",0

138081167,1159690,"Hi there, hello! - Yes, the game is in early access, yes... it does indeed need a fair few QoL and general improvements, but those are to come later down the tracks (pun intended)  I am roughly 3-4 hours into the game, and have quite enjoyed it for what it is. It draws many comparisons to Raft, but in a 3D space (void), rather than  2D surface of water.  The game, as far as I have experienced it, is very linear, as you're one ""one"" track and not able to change direction or pursue different destinations - but the game eludes to this being a thing in the future, as [spoiler] another train zooms past you [/spoiler]. This means, for the most part, you are stuck with where your train is set to go, likely for story reasons.  speaking of railroading, the tutorial is... well it's at least there, but some improvements to come! the 45 seconds that a tooltip is up, is way too long (for me), especially considering you can re-read them in the Journal. I found myself attempting to just ignore the tooltip and let it go away by itself (because I didn't want to stop what I was doing to dismiss [Hold F for 2-5 seconds] the tooltip). but after 10-15 seconds, I had enough and needed to remove the tip to see the rest of my screen (it takes up a good 25% of your screen) Some things are also not mentioned in the tutorial, like the fact that you can melee with [F], not very ""useful"" but, nice to know and weird to be surprised by! - one thing I was missing, was how to equip food, I tried to pull it into the ""Slot #1"", didn't work - What you are supposed to know, is that holding [Q] opens a wheel with all consumeables in your inventory (if there was a tooltip with it, I am terribly sorry, I did not see it!)  Attempting to stay on the tooltip topic, I feel we should swap the information around - the first note (at least when reading the one about saturation (food)) the first bit of it, is a block of text that explains you why the character in game needs food, and then there's the last little two lines that explain why food is important as a mechanic [prevents passive health regen]  You've made it this far? great, I am glad you could do that alone! Speaking of being alone, that was how I played this game... and I desperately needed people to play with. Alone, I needed to juggle: [spoiler] Picking up resources, Stuffing resources into crafters, Keeping the shark (big floating void shark) off the train, and the leeches!, shoot landmines, move the train alone the tracks, prepare for the next encounter. [/spoiler]  To me, alone, those are too many things - especially considering something like crafters take time to produce an item, not a long time, so you can't really do anything in between, unless you queue up say 5+ of one item. It felt bad as a solo player having to wait while balancing so many other things, but I can totally see it work in Co-Op where there are more hands on deck.    I never... sped up the train, other than when the game told me to... I was moving at snail pace so that I didn't need to start/stop the train while gathering resources and moving as slow as I did meant the leeches had no impact on the train, so they were just travel companions. - it gave me a lot of extra freedom, but the above topic was still in some way ""too"" stressful.   Apart from really only mentioning issues, I recommend the game, because it's early access, the idea seems interesting, and with enough love and care, this can become a great adventure game!",1

138082319,1940340,"Alright, so this was kind of a tricky review to write and I've rewritten it a few times, so I'll just cut straight to the point.  At the time of writing, this game gets a very soft non-recommendation from me. Across all my platforms (PC, Switch), I've put in around 100 hours of the original Darkest Dungeon, and played it from launch through all the patches, updates, an DLC that have come out over the years.  First and foremost, going early access on the Epic Games store sucks from my perspective. I've got a large game library in one place, on one platform, and to be frank I've been burned by a few publishers that have pulled their games from Steam. Epic bad, blah blah blah.  From a game perspective, kind of like how Darkest Dungeon 1 launched missing a lot of features we enjoy today, this sequel just don't feel fully fleshed out yet. I think the best way to describe the actual gameplay of this game would be the rouge-like progression system in Rouge Legacy 2, combined with the art style, characters, and combat from Darkest Dungeon 1, with the ""area"" progression mechanics of games like FTL.  Rather than dungeon crawling, you're now on a choose-your-own-adventure multi-path rail where your party attempts to travel from point A to B to C in a carriage, pausing for combat sequences as you run over crap on the road. It's clunky, and like other reviews have mentioned there's no carryover from runs sans for these candles which you can spend to unlock character ""placeholders"" (more on that in a minute) and various upgrades to make your runs a little bit better each time.  This upgrade point system is going to be SO GRINDY. Maybe I'm bad, but for the first ~4 hours of this game each of my runs before the first boss was pulling in around 40 candles a run. That's about enough to get the first few perks unlocked for some characters, increase your inventory by a point or two, it's obvious the devs wanted to create more replayability but I (as someone with a job) look at that and go ""I don't got time for that!""  That takes me back to character placeholders. I call them placeholders because there is no character progression outside of runs. Kind of like with Rogue Legacy 2, when you die the only thing you have leftover is your gold (candles in this case). And kind of also like in FTL, you can't just skip past the past you've already completed. Compound that with the other half of the combat system in this game being driven by RNG, it's just kind of... meh.  There's a $30 ""bundle"" for people who have the first game. I'd get that if you're a die hard fan of the series. I feel like if I could go back in time, I would maybe pay $20 for this, because I can see myself getting bored of this one quickly.",0

138082128,1940340,"Petitioning for Red Hook to make the title/tagline ""Darkest Dungeon 2: Cthulhu Road Trip Simulator""  I have over 100 hours in Darkest Dungeon, and going into Darkest Dungeon 2, I would have been more than happy for it to just be an updated ""more of the same"" situation. While on a personal level I am disappointed with some of the changes (removing the persistent hero stable in lieu of making each run an isolated instance), I am still very much enjoying the game, and the decisions they did make, while I might have preferred otherwise, make this a much more engaging and streamlined experience. It's not any easier (at least, not to me), but it feels like I have more agency - which isn't to say the game doesn't dick me over constantly--but that's just part of the experience.  In the end, this *is* more of the same - same perfect atmosphere, complete with the return of the INIMITABLE WAYNE JUNE, who remains absolute and pure perfection as the narrator - but wrapped up in new trimming with a new setting and new play cycle. I love the shift towards interpersonal relationships, replacing individual virtues and vices for different relationship dynamics (even if I do think they could have included both), which helps the group feel like more of a living, breathing organism.   All in all, this is an excellent game and an excellent sequel, building on the successes of the former while trodding on new territory and any complaints I have are, so far, purely down to personal preference and more or less wash away amidst the triumphs of this excellent game.",1

The combat is basically the same as the original game, but the overarching gameplay is more like Slay the Spire vs. Oregon Trail.   In the first game, you have a revolving roster of heroes you need to manage like a football team; whereas, in this one, you start out with four heroes of your choosing and they're unique on each playthrough and you progress their stories run-by-run. A lot of familiar mechanics are in this game, like the sanity system and characters going crazy during battle.   I had some issues during the prologue tutorial where the battles were super laggy and would freeze from time to time but that seems to have completely stopped after that prologue area. Also, the UI is a bit unwieldy to navigate when your stagecoach is moving through the map.   Cool game, ten out of ten.   ALSO: If you already own Darkest Dungeon on Steam and you plan on buying this, make sure to buy the ""Iron Crown bundle"" (comes with the first game) and not the regular version.

138081731,1940340,"Super grindy progression system that incentives you to not try anything new, and just max out what you already have.  New characters to play as? That costs you progression. But then those new characters start from the bottom of a stat upgrade path, which you need to spend progression to upgrade.  Percent chance to find a random item randomly? That will cost you.   But can you lose anything you gained, like in Darkest Dungeon 1? Are you putting time and effort into something that can be lost, creating a real sense of attachement?   Nope! You can bash your head against the wall grinding for resources, letting all your characters die and your run to go waste, only for all those characters to be ready for a new run. And if you win? It all resets anyways, but you get more progression currency.  I am incredibly upset at the progression system they added. I wish they never added it. Unfortunately I played over the refund time limit, and I doubt at this point the progression system will be overhauled or removed. Maybe I will just cheat engine myself the progression currency. Better than grinding mindlessly for it, I suppose.  I legitimately think it would have been better if you DIDN'T get a choice of progression, and you naturally unlocked things as you played. I highly preferred the old early access system, you unlock characters for playing, and the only carry over progression was unlocking new character abilities, which isn't the same as objective stat upgrades.  Darkest Dungeon 2 is NOT Darkest Dungeon 1. Adding this progression system seemed like a mistep to try and make it MORE like Darkest Dungeon 1.  Embrace dd2's differences, and remove the progression system. It doesn't belong here.",0

I've been playing for most of its Steam release day, and the tl;dr is that while it's got its charms, HypeTrain Digital has a lot to work on before it comes out of Early Access. There are lots of pain points between the brisk pace the game seems to want me to play at and the reality of optimal train-based looty shooty.  We can start with issues in the core gameplay loop, then I'll detail some nitpicks later. First, the game seems really at odds with itself when it comes to how fast it wants me to be pushing the train forward. I'd assume that the developer wants me to go fast, skimming resources as quickly as I can while getting dragged along from the rear, but letting the train putter along at minimum speed, which is free even if you've installed the engine, lets me scoop up almost everything along the track. With enough storage, this let me severely outpace what felt like the intended progression speed. I was regularly waiting to get to outposts so I could unlock whatever feature might let me actually use some of the stuff I'd researched, just by going slowly and scooping up everything. Considering that the major dangers (mines, gatehouses) are much more dangerous if you're moving fast, I felt doubly rewarded for going slow with the only caveat being gated behind arbitrary quest unlocks. The game's shark-like creature is a minor nuisance that doesn't effectively push me forward and is easily driven away or killed.  Of course, if you do decide to let loose and have some fun, the faster scramble is really fun... until you fail to see some mines and you're forced to dump loads of resources (most of which you just flew by) into repairing or replacing all of the stuff that got blown up on your train. This repair mechanic is not ideal, and while thankfully you don't lose the storage inventory of containers, going from having a full platform of storage to being roughly 100 metal scrap pickups in the red is really, really annoying. Being able to repair destroyed structures rather than losing them completely would make the mistakes a little easier to swallow, and reducing the harm of a high speed mistake would make me more likely to play faster.  Research being a linear path with a few options seems really odd, but I can appreciate having a more focused pool of progression choices. It's extremely annoying in my solo game, though, that research consumes the exact materials you end up needing to craft the item. I suppose it makes more sense in a co-op setting because as-is it feels more like a material tax than anything.  I was actually really impressed with the combat, aside from some gripes. The guns feel good to shoot and there's a variety of types, from wacky sci-fi stuff to typical dakka. The armor system in particular is neat, looping the shooting into the core train looting/crafting really well. I was not expecting to find influences from battle royales here but it fits the fast firefight style like a glove.  Okay, here are some brief nitpicks: - minefields feel way too long - weapon parts take up a full inventory space, don't stack, don't have helpful tooltips, in general the UI for them is awful, it's impossible to know what's worth taking without examining it on your armory bench - dropped enemy loot easily gets lost in grass, unless it glows (guns don't, sometimes slot machine tokens don't) - enemy soldiers are extremely difficult to see but instantly start tracking and firing on me from across an entire outpost - chip damage to my storage and production buildings on the train when they get shot at will never destroy them but is extremely annoying to look at and relatively costly to repair. I haven't found walls or barricades for my train platforms yet but being able to reinforce the train would make this way less annoying - I don't understand how the helper guys do their jobs, and they complain about not having beds and food despite having beds and crates of food being on the train - console UI stuff like holding buttons to confirm stuff can stay in the trash where it belongs  Giving VoidTrain a conditional recommend for now. If you're okay with Early Access jank and some weird narrative tone it definitely scratches that Raft/Subnautica itch without being as arrogant and off-putting as Breathedge. Here's hoping it doesn't turn into a linear corridor shooter for the last 2/3rds like Breathedge too. It would be a shame if this game turned out to be on rails. Sorry, I'll go now.",1

138083491,1940340,"I disagree with the Negative Reviews I read about this game. The path they have taken with this second instalment focuses further on the unique aspects of the game, such as the cool atmosphere and the character design and they took it to another level yet. Especially the character models and the skill animations are top notch. It is a very difficult game, more so than its predecessor. More characters are introduced and their skill lists are expanded by almost double the amount, allowing for more synergies between each party.  The rng elements are also more prominent, which in my honest opinion is a miss. It is still dependent on strategy, but relatively often a run will be lost by a random encounter that fucks you over completely. It's a gritty game, sure, but damn... A lot of elements snowball very easily and if you want to end a run early you lose all progress with the candles, which sometimes results in a party where everyone hates one another, nothing seems to work and you're just waiting for the last remaining player to die so you can start over, which sucks. If the party synergy starts to become shaky most skills a character will do will piss another off and everyone gets stressed out very fast. When max stress is reached, it is a coin flip if they will restore their hp to the max, or have their hp set to 1 (even if they were at max hp before the stress roll).  It feels like a bit of tinkering is still required for this to become more stable, but if you're into the hardcore meat-grinder element, this game is for you. I will keep playing, but it still hurts me...",1

138083384,1940340,Don't expect this to be anything like DD1 and this game is cool. More casual roguelite experience with a great atmosphere. I honestly prefer it this way because I hated losing hours of progression. I love the writing and Wayne June's narration.,1
138083208,1940340,"If you didnt play darkest dungeon 1 or didnt like the original this games alright.  But if you did play and enjoy darkest dungeon 1 this game is awful, changes everything that the game was and leaves nothing. Every mechanic has been altered and casualized. If you just want to care about micro strategies within the combat this game is fine, but any grand strategy is utterly erased. But thats just it you heal outside of combat, debuffs dont persist, theres no BIG consequence to stress, consumables are combat only, trinkets are per run, abilities are unlocked by grinding meaning you might not even be able to use your character the way you want for team comps. Enemies have deaths door now and their corpses dont go away if they die in certain ways,  This game just feels like it shed everything that was darkest dungeon for a generic rogue like. In all honesty ive grown tired of the combat from just a few hours of playing since thats the only thing you will be doing in this installment, that is other than staring at your screen while the game auto paths for you because you dont have to anymore.  Also where is the crusader? houndmaster? arbalest? shieldbearer? and wth happened to the flagellant why is he a blight character now, if red hook needed a blight character for front line they had shieldbearer, who was my absolute go to character. I genuinely dont know what the point of the vestal is after shes been altered as i havent picked her since seeing the cooldown on her heal, occultist is just better every time as a healer now.  Ive run into a few of the boss fights and i got to say they just arent good, if you dont know their mechanics you are probably dead. I used an attack on row 3/4 which targeted an invulnerable thing at the 4th rank that i didnt care about, turns out thats a death trap and you arent going to have fun if you do that. Fought another boss that is kinda like the old prophet, except that if they make it to front rank its basically a wipe so my melee guys who i was having target the debris to gain access to a full team damage were utterly useless and infact just serving to kill me. Now normally id not complain since in darkest dungeon 1 you can run from fights and build for specific bosses. But uh, this game you cant,,,",0

Don't listen to these negative Nancys in the reviews lol. The game will change and keep getting better as time goes on... and the bugs will be fixed.  My Takes: 1) I actually enjoy the narrator, otherwise it'd be too quiet and i'd get bored, but to each their own. 2) The storage containers have to be bigger and hold more things lol i agree with everyone on that subject. 3) To the person who said they only need/use wood for fuel, you can also use fat (that's as far as i know,only 3 hours in) 4) Some people talk about exploration. You are tethered to a train, what kind of freedom do you expect to have? lol  overall realistic rating: 7/10 my personal rating: 8/10 (im just loving survival crafting games right now)  P.S. and you get a Revolver with unlimited ammo, got me feeling like Clint Eastwood.",1

If your controllers do have face buttons though, I can definitely recommend it so far. It's been very fun",0

138083729,2229260,"After having played for over 50 hours directly thorugh the website of the developer I can certainly not recommend that game to anyone. The main reasons being:  [h1] Leveling [/h1] For the Lv 45 Cap that is being implemented at the time of this post people are getting way too much exp. So when the Lv 40 Cap dropped some people managed to get to max Level within half a day. And below lv 50 there are no trials so the ""endgame"" is pretty limited.  [h1] Bugs [/h1] Even though the game was only re-released and not built up from scratch there are lots of bugs in the game like graphic bugs which can only be resolved by relogging or skills that do not work as intended. For example the Lv 25 Bard Skill ""Burning Metal"" does only stack 2 times instead of the 3 times it should.  [h1]Game-breaking stuff[/h1] Gold and Item duping was possible from release day for at least 4 days and the incidents have yet to be resolved with no rollback happening.  [h1]Cash Shop[/h1] The real money to cash currency ratio is pretty bad. For 7'700 Eden Points (Cash currency) + 370 Gift Points (Cash currency for non tradeable items) you have to pay 250 USD. For example an Eden Crystal costs 59 Eden Points. That equals roughly 2 USD which is pretty hefty.  [h1]Communication[/h1] While there is absolutely no communication ingame happening between players and the staff the main platform for communication/information seems to be the official Eden Eternal Discord Server. On that Discord Server announcements are either made late or right before something is happening. The announcements also get changed without notice on a regular basis.",0

So all you need is good aim or good prediction to win. I once got my ass beat by some guy with a headband using his fists because he knew how to fight me. The crafting system is pretty neat allowing you to basically make your own loadout to an extent, i like using ranged weapons because its deals alot of damage and melee players cant block them unless they have armor. So i think this game is good  but i think in the near future the game will get more popular and so the game might be faster to play and just generally more fun.

138085169,1940340,"The UI is very clunky and unpolished. Like half of the time you have no idea what your Spells really do. There are 4 different icons in my ability and it's difficult to tell. There is a fullscreen detail view of the character, that shows pretty much the same thing. Some further points: * You open all menus with left click, EXCEPT characters - you can only open THOSE with right-click for no reason * Labels (for locations, or continue) are sometimes in the Center, sometimes Left, sometimes Right. It's always a ""very is the button to continue"" game * Stagecoach adds flair but is so pointless. You can steer, yet it does absolutely nothing (besides choosing your way at a crossroad) * Upgrading a skill or buying stuff features a small diamond that you need to HOLD left mouse on. That's never explained anywhere and took me a good 20 seconds to figure out. Also it works REEEEAAAALLLY shitty with my bluetooth mouse. Never had that problem in any game before, but I think some small connection losses restart the timer completely. Introduce a grace period or just slowly run the timer into the opposite direction if you don't detect a click - Jesus! * UI in general is slow (e.g. opening your bag) and feels off * Too much stuff isn't explained. My hero got ""DESPAIRED"" - nothing told me that that gave him a negative trait * The fight starts and like 5 Buffs appear - no one ever explained to me where they are from  Huge fan of Darkest Dungoen I and Roguelikes, so I had such high hopes for this game. What a disapointment.  Take a UX-for-the-absolute-oblivious class please. Like if you use icons just make a tooltip on hover to show what they do. Not a hotkey that opens a view with ALL ICONS, where I have to find my icon, than hover over THAT and than I STILL have questsions.....",0

The problem is that this doesn't offer nearly enough to warrant the current price tag.  The developer needs to re-read Steams policies on early access titles and not be trying to charge a price based on what the game promises or hopes to be when it comes out of early access.  $15 USD is wayyyyyyyyyyyy too much to ask for what feels more like $3 worth of actual content here.  One map.  One zombie asset over and over and over.  One gun with no new guns to buy or obtain.  No power-ups.  No zombie dogs, zombie birds, nothing but the same zombie asset over and over.  UGH.  https://youtu.be/XrDu-pybpKc  The developer also tried to add challenge as you advance through the waves by making the same zombie asset move at ridiculous speeds by the time you hit wave 3.  These guys seriously look like they are moving at 40 MPH+ way too quickly.  I advise to the developer to slowly increase the zombie speed and add new interesting enemies over time instead.

138088040,1940340,"As a huge DD1 fan this just feels like a half baked disappointment with too many basic features missing to even count, not to mention the ui looks like its supposed to be for ios. sucks man",0
138087918,1940340,"Game is awesome. Soundtrack, mood, gameplay, narration, all top notch and for me a better experience than DD1.",1
138087877,1940340,4/10,0
138087819,1940340,It's Darkest Dungeon... But then... It's not the Darkest Dungeon...,1
138087525,1940340,"The game is very fun. Combat with 3D characters becomes much smoother and cooler. Many annoying points in the combat of part one have been resolved. More skills to combine in battle. I also like the character development through the heroes' backstory. Grave Rubber my Wife ;>  - There are currently no Color Skins for heroes, I feel this is very regrettable.   - Some characters of DD1 now do not appear in the current version, you will miss them. Maybe they will appear in future updates.  - Inn is good but setting up camp could be an additional opportunity to the game in the future.  - So the economy in the game is quite one-way, you can only buy but can't sell items. This makes looting less interesting.  - Enemy combinations don't have as much randomness as DD1, they often appear in certain formations. This can be good or bad for some people.  - Workshop - Mods plss... DD2's potential is great, DD2's art style is also great. And I know you need time to help moddings make mods for DD2. Don't waste this precious time. Let them soon start improving this great game.  - I think this game should be called Darkest Wago... lol. I don't think Dungeon gameplay should be completely removed from DD2. They should turn it into a series of small and large Dungeons that can be entered and explored, on the route.",1
138087283,1940340,"I liked DD1, and I'm not necessarily against this new roguelite approach. What I'm against is that the game is set off to make you fail from the start, and only painful grinding can possibly solve this. And the real issue is that there's basically nothing you can do against it. If the intent was to make the player despair and feel helpless, then congratulations, it's a success. As a game, not so much. My main issues include: - Your heroes WILL hate each other's guts by the time you reach the mountain, and probably before that. Cue massive penalties and debuffs. And in the first (dozen?) runs at least, there's absolutely no way to prevent this - yay, I can use this inn item to boost a relationship from 2/20 to 3/20! - Boss fights don't give any tactical info. Hey, the librarian is using the books to attack, so maybe I should destroy the books to weaken him? Great idea, enjoy your guaranteed game over. Maybe I'm just not used to trial and error gameplay anymore, but this doesn't feel right. Or fun. - Zero choice in heroes and skills in the beginning - you have exactly enough heroes and skills for a full set. I don't mind unlocking them as the game progresses, but for skills you have to visit specific locations and it unlocks ONE skill for ONE hero each time. Too much grinding. - They removed hit chance from DD1, but rest assured, the game is still just as random. Debuffs are ridiculously unreliable, and those stacks of Blind (50% miss chance) and Dodge (50% dodge chance) make many battles feel like a lottery.  Yes, I would likely have more options after I accumulate a few hundred candles. No, I don't think I'm going to do that, because I expect a game to be reasonably fun even in the beginning, not after a few dozen hours.  TL;DR I enjoy difficult games, not games that are ""difficult"" because you face overwhelming numbers and there's no way to play smart until you've failed countless times.",0

Well, it turns out that the only thing from Epic Games that gets installed is the Online Services. It's not a big deal, don't exaggerate... It's not like they're installing the EGS launcher, in that case, I would have asked for a refund right away...  I was harsh regarding Epic Online Services in my comment on Returnal; I need to change that... But honestly, I prefer this over having the EGS launcher on my PC.  I played for an hour, and well, I like it. It's chill, yes it's linear, but that's fine with me, we are guided through the creation steps, it seems logical... Just like Satisfactory.

138090598,1940340,"The negative reviews for this game baffle me. Darkest Dungeon 2 is a good game, great even, but it is very different from the first game. I personally like the new direction of this game more than the original, but I can understand that many people disagree. But no matter which one you prefer, the fact is that DD2 is a good game on it's own, and people are leaving negative reviews because they like it less than DD1. The price is a bit steep, so maybe wait for a sale if you're on the fence, but if you enjoy rougelites and you enjoyed the original you will most likely enjoy this game.",1
138090355,1940340,Will try again when mods fix the issues I have but for now play DD1 its better in every way.,0
138090291,1940340,"Its good if you like Darkest Dungeon, but not worth the current price. It almost feels like Darkest Dungeon 1 should be a sequel to this. The ambitions are lower, the game is less deep, every good Idea it has is followed by 2 that make it a worse game than its predecessor. Give it a year or two of patches, content updates and DLC and it might be worth the time, but even then I highly doubt it will ever reach the same heights the first game had.  Play it when you are bored of DD1, wait for Black Reliquary to have a full sequel.",0
138090218,1940340,"Interesting sequel to DD. Small issues in UI and clarity are resolved after an hour of gameplay, when you use your brain to learn things and eyes to read.  You only have a squad of 4 members for a more linear, zone based gameplay loop that takes a few hours. Instead of using some random low stress characters you have lying around that you don't even know the names of, you get used to the people in the squad, learning things about them and how their quirks affect their gameplay, getting way more attached than in DD1.  The combat is largely the same, only you can see the turn order now and every attack has a baseline 100% hit chance. Stress has been merged into the relationship system and it is more dynamic than some stats up or down. Depending on the relationship between characters, certain moves will buff/debuff the other. Stress will lead to a meltdown, damaging you and reducing the relationship with other characters or rarely do the opposite. They added a lot of new status effects that might confuse you, if you can't read and have never played an rpg before.  There are less characters with more skills, but i hope the missing ones will be added in the future, because all characters now have backstories. One issue is that to unlock the skills and story, you have to travel to a location during a run and choose one from your party to unlock an essentially random skill for. So if there's a character whose base skills you really don't like, you're forced to use them until they're playable. The progression system is fine, you get candles throughout your runs and for achieving specific goals. I have already unlocked all of the stagecoach upgrades on a whim and unlocked all characters after beating the second big boss. The system is largely there to ease you into all the unlockables and make the game easier, or harder if you choose to. Difficulty was one of the largest critiques for DD1, so it's interesting that they addressed it by gradually making it easier the more you fail (again, if you choose to). Unlocking items is slow as hell for some reason and it's discouraging me from unlocking them all in one go, so i hope they can speed that up. DD2 isn't a strict improvement on DD1 on all fronts, that wasn't the goal. If you liked the gameplay of darkest dungeon more than spending 20 minutes on gold and stress managing your 26 character classes, get this.",1
138090168,1940340,Love it!,1
138090128,1940340,"I just started this game. I feel like it is much more punishing than DD1, but this time you also have almost no tools to play around things. I feel even more powerless than in DD1, almost nothing is in my control. Not good.",0
138090043,1940340,"the game is pretty slow, and since you die so much, it becomes very repetitive very quickly.",0
138089962,1940340,"I wish they could see that the games original format was perfection, and that if they just added new features and developed the art style as they did, that the game would feel a lot more rewarding and enjoyable, I feel sad that we got this and not an actual Darkest Dungeon II, this game shouldn't even be called Darkest Dungeon, I think if they gave it a different title I would feel a lot less sad over what we have here, this just isn't Darkest Dungeon",0
138089678,1940340,"This idea that, because it's a rogue-like, you have to get utterly pummeled without any recourse by the first boss encounter is just absolutely stupid design. I mean, why not just add a timer for 10 hours that says, ""Hey, you're going to lose all your encounters and runs pretty much until this arbitrary timer runs out. Then we've decided you've grinded enough.""  There is no element of skill. It's just sheer luck and grinding until you put in enough time and grind that the game demands. Feels broken and boring to be forced to watch your group get wrecked because of arbitrary nonsense.",0

138090117,1730250,"A very relaxing and beautiful game, with  some similarities to Dorf Romantic, but this games unique mechanics and flat difficulty make it much more accessible,",1
138089507,1730250,"Mixed Review! Negative to make aware of current issues - will changed to positive when the issues are mostly solved.  The game itself is pretty good - it brings a new twist to the formula known by other games with its own charme and i love the evolving tiles - makes your little world grow and change as you progress.  BUT the game has its issues right now - bugs and/or poor design choice - the result is the same. They hinder gameplay and frustrate or temper with the longjavity of the game. - The controls are a big issue and mostly a bad design choice as of now since they work as intended stated by the developer but it makes no sense and does not work for me. (rotating tiles does not work with mouse, zoom does not work with mouse while placing quest tiles, its a mess.) - FPS in the menu are uncapped (fps cap through driver only works when going into a map) using the gpu to its maximum and causing unnecessary heat and power draw. - Although there seem to be many unique building and a good variety in tiles with the evolving visuals - every map will in the end look very similar in its style. I wish there was more variety like snow, different color biomes.  Im a bit picky here and the game is fair priced but i still expect more for the money than currently offered. (As a whole smooth package). The game still has alot of potential - please dont waste it devs :-).",0

138089062,1159690,its got a few bugs some bad yes but its a blast at the end of the day,1
138088952,1159690,Narrator seem quite appropriate for this quirky yet fun game. Runs great for me. I usually detest linear games but this one seems to be well thought out and im enjoying it.  Day one Early release review. I am not having any issues with the complaints made by others on the review threads.  Good luck devs,1
138088593,1159690,"Just a couple hours of play - so this is a ""first impressions"" review. I'll update it later on once I have more under my belt.  - The introduction to getting started is pretty well done - especially for an early access game. - The method of crafting and getting things is reasonably intuitive. However, being able to click-lock a recipe so one can mouse-over the necessary items to in turn find out where they're made or are from would be a good option (or toggle). - The tether is a wee bit short. Just a touch longer, and just a touch faster. That said, this may come later on through crafting, so if that's the case, it's just fine. - The voice acting is fun! I would love more of it. (I'll volunteer! Professionally trained and everything!) - I would like to see more world-interaction. - There needs to be grid-snapping for placement (and perhaps 4-5 grid sizes on the platform). - As others have mentioned, hopefully crafting becomes less linear later on. - Some way (perhaps later?) to draw craft items from boxes. Also, to be able to queue items and have more than one output per table (or output to box). - Currently, the pull to train gets the player jammed up on the side, should jump onto the platform. - Pretty smooth - although some animations can be a bit too jerky. - The atmosphere is good. Once more work has been done it'll be very cool! - Character creation is alright. Should have an option to remove atmospheric effects.  Overall, my first impressions are that it's a well thought out game in its current state. I am writing this based on it being a day-one release, early access, AND seeing that the dev(s) has(have) responded to issues within hours of finding them (there are several areas in the threads where the response has been ""Working on it"" then a couple hours later ""fixed"". I do hope this keeps up.  I'll try to remember to revise and update this later!",1
138088483,1159690,Hip fire and ads sensitivity is the exact same. Will buy the game again if a separate slider for ads sensitivity is added. In its current state aiming is cancer.,0

138089634,1582380,"The game crashed on me half an hour in ... can't access my save game anymore since it won't load at all and sent me back into the main menu. Tried to create another save game, where I then got locked in the starting screen of the game. Every startup resets your audio settings, even if it gives you a saving prompt after changing them. ... Overlays won't be shown at times and the options have such a buggy UI.  Controller support is basically non existent. This is known and it gives you a warning ... but if you can't even dash, which is one of the main mechanics, then I would just leave the ""controller support"" out of it for now. Especially if you disconnect your controller and it then leaves you in a state where it always opens up the menu every 2 seconds.  As for the game... I didn't really get far but here's a bit The bosses I encountered so far look way too tanky, but maybe it's designed, that you shouldn't beat the first bosses? You can get locked into states that leave you to being unable to beat the game anymore.  I think the game does have potential, but it isn't worth the time or money at this point. For example I love the graphics and general game mechanics so far... but the bugs and glitches ... yeah  I usually like to support indie devs but this game currently feels unplayable to me. For now the price is totally outrageous... and you shouldn't put a game into early access that just crashes and then makes you start over ... if it even let's you start over",0

It's a well made fighting game, so much so that it's surprising to think about how this is a fan-made game. The team behind this game put two years of work into this game despite knowing they would not be making any money off of this project. The game is truly a labor of love, with a very passionate dev team behind it.  It's hard for me to not recommend this game as for one, it's a free game. The only thing you have to give to play it is your time. If you end up not liking it, that's fine, but at least you didn't have to give your money and your time.",1

I was actually looking forward to a more ""roguelite-y"" game, but this just feels bland, with features that feel unfinished, unpolished or outright weird.  Like, the caravan steering mechanic. What does it add to the experience other than reminding you of a mobile game? It is so out of place and bizarre that I'm genuinely curious to find out how they came with that.  A good example of unpolished mechanic is the combo system. In theory it is very interesting to have some abilities inflict a ""combo"" status effect that pretty much any other ability can benefit from. But the benefit you get from it is so underwhelming that you quickly forget this mechanic exist. Ability upgrades are also pretty underwhelming.  All in all a very bland experience, but I wouldn't give this a bad review if the game wasn't so damn expensive. There is no world where this is worth 40 euros. Not in its current state.",0

The people complaining it's a rogue like now and not the long campaign that DD1 was. --- The game has been out on Epic for OVER a year now and the devs were very open about DD2 being a more rogue like and focusing on shorter run times. You had plenty of time and opportunities to educate yourself on the type of game this would be but yet you didn't. That's a you issue.  2. The people who have like .5 hrs played on steam but say they ""put in over 70 hours on the Epic Store"" so ""I know what I'm talking about."" --- What? You put in OVER 70 hours of the game on the Epic Store, KNEW you didn't like the game, and then continued to buy the game on Steam just so you could leave a negative review? Sure, buddy, sure.   The game is great. Your first run is probably going to be rough until you learn the ins and outs of the systems and each subsequent run becomes just a lil bit easier as you unlock things through the candles system. Just stick with it and you'll enjoy it I promise.",1

138091992,1940340,"[b]This review is a bit on the ""ranting"" side, but hear me out ...[/b]  How does it come that so many people are posting negative reviews, because they expected a slighty altered version of the first game?   Darkest Dungeon II has been out in [i]early excess[/i] for over a year already, so there are tons of videos and streams online to check if it suits your taste. Also the game got at least two [i]gameplay[/i] trailer, as well as Red Hook Studios themself communitcated clearly, that they wanted to try a different approach to their world, characters and mechanics. They did exactly that. Nothing more, nothing less.  So my question is, how could it happen, that some people are still surprised to find out, that Darkest Dungeon 2 is totally different from the first one? It was clear from the start.  You don't have to like it, but don't blame the dev's for trying something new, while not reading even a tiny bit about the product yourself, before buying it. Its your own fault if you buy something while knowing nothing about the product, but a name.  Darkest Dungeon II itself is a [i]fine game[/i]. It looks great, performs well enough and introduced lots of new mechanics (some are more welcome than others, thats for sure), which would not have worked in the hub-managing style of the first game. Overall its just as stressing as the first one. Maybe even a bit more. My only concern is, that you have to grind even more than in the first one. I personally don't have time for all of that.  In terms of content, I [i]feel[/i] like we are getting less than in the first one, but Red Hook already said, they want to support the game post launch with updates and some new content (some free, some paid). I am fine with that and still hoping for a return of my beloved Shieldbreaker. But if the game really is worth 40 bucks ... thats for you to decide. I'd have waited for a sale, if there wasn't the reduced price for owners of the first game.  Sorry for errors, I am not a native. Thank's for coming to my ted talk.",1

This game clearly needs more work before I give it another shot, not worth my time or money at the moment.

138091610,1159690,"While the game is definitely early access (and it shows how many people leaving reviews have never played one) there's still a *very* fun core gameplay loop, astonishing music and sound design, and a fun story that doesnt take itself too seriously in all the right ways. I mean a narrator? I never saw that coming the VA is such a blast. Even just visually, the game has a unique look and feel that makes me consider my money well spent only *four hours in*.   The devs seem to be very on top of any major issues that pop up and are handling this like a good early access should be handled. If you're okay playing a game in a state where crashes, bugs, and other issues *might* be something you come across, with the upside of getting to influence the direction of the game as its developed, then please try it! There's tons of room to grow here and a dev team that seems ready to see it through. Need I remind people of games like Raft and Deep Rock Galactic when they first released in EA? They were a hot mess at the best of times and look at them now - for smaller teams an EA release is the best way to make sure the final product is as good as can be so ignore the complaining that the 'tutorial is too hard' after an hour of gameplay (seriously. do these people even play games at all?) and start playing!",1

138093108,2229260,"I played Eden Eternal back when it was first released all the way up to 2016. I spent hours on this game and I can assure you it was well deserved. It is the kind of mmorpg I always wanted. The style is adorable, the story is cute, fun to play with others and meet new people, and who doesn't love Alpacas? ^u^   I am so happy to see Eden Eternal back, and now available on steam. The way it is playing right now reminds me when the game first came out all those years back. Sure there is a cap at lv 45 right now, but trust me when I say this, it won't stay long. There is many many more lands to travel, and if i can recall i was lv 100. :)    What we have right now is Classic Eden Eternal. What the game was when it first released. There is nothing wrong with that either as I know over time they will add the other features back. The game is quite large, so working with a smaller portion of it, will probably help the creators fix any bugs and issues at the begging. And as time progresses and bugs are fixed, they will keep patching and updating until we get the Eden I played around 2014 to 2016. :)   As for the whole paywall. I have always been a member who played without purchasing real in game items. The prices are not all that bad. We need to remember we are playing a classic MMORPG ten years later. With inflation and other things going on, prices have gone up everywhere and on others games too. It's not all the bad for this game considering I have seen prices waaaay higher elsewhere. It stinks sure, but again, we need to remember the times we are currently faces in the world right now. For the game to stay up an run well, we need to consider they also need to fix the currency to match the now times. :)   Also, This game  doesn't have to be a pay to win/progress, do your daily missions, do the book missions from the merchant, finish all the main missions, have a relationship with another player to gain exp bonus, and join a guild. Doing all this and you will have no problems making in game currency and exp if your having issues.  Will it take longer? Sure? But rewards after for it is worth it. :)  If you want to pay  real currency for outfits and mounts, nothing wrong with that, but as stated before, do realize prices have gone up because in this day in age, everything prices have gone up, and developers needed to make adjustments to afford keeping the severs running. :)  Over all guys, just have fun! The world of Eden Eternal is exciting!! And for those new, don't let negative comments keep you from trying it yourself. Give it ago, and judge it with your own opinions. :)   P.s. I Hope to see Sakura Island reappear at Aven too! Loved going there even with the creepy music. x,D",1

Pros: - Amazing sprite work - The various Mythology Gags and references  - Having a Combo Breaker system for people like me that get constantly juggled - Having actual singleplayer content - Acknowledging Coco, Aloe, and even Rushia's existence unlike so many other Hololive fan projects   Cons: - No difficulty selection nor Continues for Arcade mode.  - No quickplay option for Online matches - Getting booted back to the main menu if your online opponent decides not to continue - Despite having rollback netcode, I've experienced slowdown more than once in online matches (although this could just be my terrible internet) - No visible way to keep track of online win/loss records (which seems important, since that's how you unlock one of the available color palettes) - Noticed a bug where the character flip-flops between color palettes while viewing the move list - Ollie being the only NPC with voice acting seems kinda weird. I know that this is something beyond the devs' control, but I'd still appreciate if they could somehow get audio recordings from the others.

There are still bugs such as when the game randomly slows down in matches, but I know the devs are skillful enough to fix them soon.   Since I don't mind much about either the gameplay or the issues of the game, I think there are some stuffs should be added into it visually to make Idol Showdown become your ""classic fighting game"" something like: win poses, special intros and interactions, arcade endings(???)

138096054,1940340,I found this game to be very unintuitive. There's a lot of tokens they never bother to explain in game. There's a lot of interfaces where tokens are displayed and don't allow hovering so you can even see what they are. It still needs a lot of work in making the game more accessible. I effectively need to play with a game guide open just to understand what's happening in combat. Some of the out of combat interfaces also aren't explained or obvious what you can do on them.  Combat itself is...fine. It's frustrating and confusing due to the above and isn't enough to make up for the rest of the game.,0

138095692,1940340,"Darkest Dungeon 2 departs from the hamlet-driven mechanics of the first game for more of a true roguelike experience. Each run is self contained, once you win or lose, you start from the beginning. During a run you collect candles; the persistent currency you spend at the end of runs to purchase items that will show up always in later runs, or to mildly buff heroes forever whenever you take them again. (One example is the Plague Doctor's first buff is +3% deathblow resistance)  The roguelike run structure is similar to other path-base games like slay the spire. You run into crossroads where you can choose which direction to go to face different challenges, battles, lairs, a place to rest, get some items, expand a heroes story, etc.  My favorite part of DD2 so far is the combat. It was great in the first game and it's still great here. I find it better mostly due to the new 3D models and animations, they are fantastic, weighty, and a pleasure to see, time after time.  Some fans may be upset that a lot of elements from the first game are missing, however I'm enjoying my experience, and of course Darkest Dungeon 1 still exists.",1

Take the world/atmosphere of DD and mix it with the fine tuned turn based tactical combat...now mix that combat with FTL and Slay the Spire and it's sorta like DD2.

138096027,1159690,"Everything that is an EGS exclusive comes out on steam sooner or later. Voidtrain is one of them. I read the reviews, the game scolded for various bugs and dampness, but wait, the game is in early access, it is written on the page and you are still notified about it when you start the game!  I've played so far only an hour and a half and have not encountered any bugs. Someone didn't like the shooting, but I was pleasantly surprised her. It is quite at the level. Although I have only shot so far with a gun. Who scolds the collection of resources and crafting... Seriously? This is a survivalist, this is the essence of the game! In general, I do not understand the complaints of players. I played solo, in the co-op until lez. The game is a mix of Raft game and the movie Snowpiercer. Graphically it looks very unpretentious, even with some kind of Cel-shaded effect, and the game is made on UE4, but okay, sorry, it's an indie game. Create your character, the choice is very poor, but it's not so important. We have a small platform, which rushes through space on rails, we can go forward, we can go backward, or stop altogether. As in Raft, while driving we collect various resources, with which we craft other resources and build workbenches, improve your future carriage. We can not fly away, because tied to the rope to its platform, there is no gravity. At intervals, will meet the station, which we investigate for weapons, recipes and resources.  There is a lot of crafting here, I even got tired when making a simple bandage. We need to do something about it, to simplify the steps. When approaching the first station, I was impressed by the soundtrack. I thought there was some kind of danger, perhaps waiting for me to fight, such was the tension in the music, I liked it :) In steam, the page with the game have screenshots and videos where we fight the monsters already built a train, man, it's cool, I do not know if it's all in the early access, but what I played, I liked it.  In this game will not return soon, because it is in early access, and I do not like survival in early access, as after any updates break the save or my world, have to start over. I have this experience with Rust. So I'm waiting for the full release.  Bought the game on reserve, it will obviously go up in price as soon as the full version comes out.",1

The small space to work with creating a challenge - Something that is just gorgeous to play. Something that is still being developed and loved, something that is just fun.   That narrator has my heart. Destroying defenceless creatures for their resources. Just being able to swim around in an open void.  Recommended. I cannot wait to see how much further this game could go with more time.",1

Sitting back and watching the scenery is something you could do for hours on your train, but you don't have to, because there's so much more to constantly do! The game is always teasing you with the next step in progression, and it feels great to reach it! The game is gorgeous, the devs are incredible, the aesthetic choices are so fun and full of life.

138095300,1159690,"Like Raft, you're on a base floating through a sea of junk that you can pull in to build up your base.   Unlike raft, you have a narrator yacking in your ear and assuming the worst of the player's intelligence, connecting dots for you. I really do not see the need for a narrator in any survival crafting game, as the crux of these games are meant to be immersion and experimentation. I think it would be better if the narrator was potentially replaced by an NPC that gives you advice or could be toggled off.  Going back to the experimentation, there is a research line (not a tree, it's a single line) that the game *tries* to be helpful with an give quests to walk through it. It feels a little condescending, and again, having it be optional would be better.  The final mark for me is the lighting. there is no flashlight, so when it gets dark, you either have to crank the brightness to see, or fumble in the dark. This was very apparent when I ended up at an outpost on a path that was set at ""night"" and I just could not see the enemies at all  until I boosted the brightness and made it look like an oldtimey movie night scene.  There's also an awkwardness when playing on controller that the radial menus imply using an analog stick to point in the direction of the item you wish to use/build. when using a particular UI layout, you should follow what is expected of that layout. However, the most glaring part of the UI is the steam engine. When you attempt to select a item to use for the steam engine, you would expect to use the d-pad for selection as everything else does. *This is not the case.* UI elements, when similar in form, should work the same same way.  I won't be recommending this *for now* but we'll have to see what the future brings.  For the Devs: - add a flashlight or more ambient light - standardized UI functionality (radial menu selection with analog, the steam engine) - a ""hands off"" mode that let's the player organically discover the research and story.",0

138094443,1159690,I love the game but there are a few things that don't work very well or I don't like. Once you got to your third or fourth station you feel like it's the station from the last time. Also there I think that the pulling back to the train is a bit to slow and not really useful. Another thing I dislike is that the animations of the building menu and the hammer are really long and slow. Maybe you could make it a bit faster for a more enjoyable experience. Collecting resources works very well and you get guided from the start on. It's not really difficult but the shooting feels a bit weird.

However I'll also be honest and say that this game just isn't very polished, so unless you're looking for a game to play with friends who are fans of Hololive (and I personally don't really care about the vast majority of Twitch streamers out there, including the entirety of Hololive) or for something that's first and foremost meant for fun, you're probably not gonna enjoy this, especially if you like to play fighting games compatitively. But hey, it's free, so I have nothing to actually complain about.  I'll go back to this game and try more of it because I can see how dedicated the devs are, but overall it does lack a bit of polish, especially in the animation/game feel department.

As a (currently) noob to the game, I fell in love after the first match I played. It's also gladdening to see single-player content - offline battles, an arcade mode, and even what looks like a story mode!  [b]But what can make this better?[/b]  [u]More characters[/u], for starters. There's currently eight playable VTubers with three more in development (who knows who THEY'LL be...?) and nine Collab VTubers, making a grand total of 20 included in the game in some playable form. That's already pretty good, but we can go higher. I know the game's, well, Hololive-focused but including even more VTubers in the future - even some from other companies - would be an absolute blast. It'd be the [i]Smash Ultimate[/i] of VTuber-based fighting games, of which there are surprisingly few. (Hey, if that wouldn't work, there's an idea for a sequel...!)  [u]Achievement support[/u] would also be a great addition for achievement hunters such as myself but, obviously, not everybody's into that sort of thing, nor is it always necessary. I feel it would be a great way to not only show mastery of the game, but provide some incentive for people that may not try other modes to, well, try other modes, other characters, maybe even some super-specific stuff.  Also, [u]v-sync[/u] would be a nice touch, make the game a bit smoother.  Aside from that? Honestly, I don't think there's much else. The game's already spectacular - but hey, that's kinda the thing about fan games, isn't it? These people truly care not just about the source material, but the very thing they're making. Sure, for some more experienced experts at fighting games, the game does have some flaws, but [u]I'm not a fighting game expert - I'm a filthy casual[/u] and, despite whatever flaws it may or may not have, there's no denying the overall positive reception it's garnered.

I have played 6 hours only but I can say I'm hooked on the gameplay loop and know I'm having fun. There is a lot less micromanaging outside of combat than in the first game too so it's just a lot easier to get right into the action.

This is relatively easily fixable in diffrent ways, and for anyone who plays enough hours won't even care about/be confused by, take your pick. it's a barrier to entry. -Critical hit-killing blows not removing corpses consistantly, dono why this changed, i learnt to rely on it in DD1 and tried the same here, but does not work. -DoT's being removed on corpses, just because the boy died, doesn't mean he's no longer on fire yknow what i mean. altho i noticed some interesting new oppertunities with corpses.  on the surface it looks like i have alot of bad to say, and i dont even think so, the gripes i have are minor in nature and mostly resolved by playing more, which i intend to do anyway. what is interesting, this game is not the death of DD1, despite their similarities, you can play both and get diffrent experiences that are fulfilling as a player, so that's a great win! missing some heroes, but maybe DLC/progression/future updates will bring some characters over  PS: please make it so that if i rename a hero at the crossroads, it remains that name forever, or make me able to somewhere put in a list of male/female names which are randomly selected upon hero generation, as much as i like the names dismas and baldrick etc. i like to personalise my playing characters and i dont wana rename them every single time considering a run can take 5 minutes, but also 2+ hours.",1

138103863,2055910,"Incredibly addicting and fun, its a very simple game that pulls you in and refuses to let go. My whole community got it and started competing with each other and now we are fighting for leader board spots. Can't recommend this enough <3",1

138104883,1940340,"So far, it's a pretty good game. My only gripe is the dodge mechanic. Making every attack a 50/50 roll is incredibly annoying when RNG decides to fuck you over. It goes from ""oh I made a mistake so I deserve to die here"" to ""oh I missed 4 coinflips in a row and now I die"" which is not fun.",1

138104763,1940340,Is a very different game from DD1 but keeps the spirit of the game extraordinarily well.,1
138104321,1940340,I would probably not be playing the game if not for having my progress from early access come over. The early game grind for unlocking character moves is a needless pain that severely limits the fun of Darkest Dungeon.  Once you have most of your moves unlocked you can start putting together some interesting team compositions and the game really opens up.,1

138104241,1940340,"Don't go in expecting this game to be more of the same. The combat feels similar like a Darkest Dungeon game, but the overall structure of the game is very new.   In the first game you had a roster of 10-20 maybe more heroes and lost them from time to time and played very much like a roleplaying game with a bit of rougelite elements sprinkled in there.  From this perspective the new game is pretty much turned on its head. It is very much a rougelite with light roleplaying mechanics sprinkled in there.  Trust me - Darkest Dungeon is very good. But it is a diffrent experience from the first game.  Different does not always mean bad. And this is a happy example how another perspective in the same universe can be very good as well.  I therefore fully recommend - also at full price.",1
138104235,1940340,DD2 has a constant feeling of movement compared to DD1 using the stagecoach to explore and interact with the game.  On the flip side its missing the brief feeling of stillness and calm that the hamlet brought in between expeditions.,1

138102932,2397700,"Ambition. A characteristic that can mean good as well as bad. It can build Civilisations or destroy them. Tristan, a man was once send to Atlantis. To prevent the Downfall of this civilisation. He was send in hope that his knowledge and insight could save them from its fate. This is his Story.  Welcome to CRYSTAL OF ATLANTIS!  Well my friends, as you can see momently i´m having a Match 3 Addiction. So, let´s have a look at this one. CRYSTALS OF ATLANTIS looks like a typical Match 3 Game. Pair three or more of one Kind to clean them. Simple mechanic.   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2974129272  CRYSTALS OF ATLANTIS stands out from other games for several reasons, one of which is the challenging levels. Unlike pointless clicking that doesn't lead to any result, this game presents well-thought-out puzzles that require careful consideration. Each level brings specific requirements that players must meet and adds an element of strategy and problem-solving to the gameplay. In addition, CRYSTALS OF ATLANTIS offers a number of helpful extras that enrich the gaming experience and provide assistance. These valuable resources make beating the levels a little easier and provide players with useful tools to overcome obstacles. To sum up, CRYSTALS OF ATLANTIS not only fascinates players with its unique concept and addictive gameplay, but also stands out for its carefully designed levels and the inclusion of useful extras.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2974129048  Solving Levels will give you stars you need for upgrades to make Atlantis stronger and maybe survive. That is in your Hand. Do it the relaxing way, without a Timer or the more challenging way, with a Timer. I tried both and all i can say, this Game is never unfair.   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2974129511  The Graphics are very nice drawn and that goes also for the Sounds. I also enjoyed the Story that is not that special, but exciting done. I played over 10 Hours, don´t wonder, i did most offline.  Thanks to the Developer for this interesting Journey, i really liked it.  I recommend it for every Match 3 Lover, who love a challenging but not unfair one. Because of the Relaxing Mode i also recommend it for newcomers.  All for a good price.  Thank you for reading.

138102658,1730250,"This is far better than these stupid aarp games they give to us 83 year olds. It looks at first glance that it's simple. But it is not. There is a skill attached to it. And,No I ain't senile. I should stand for President it seems to be I am in the right age group. Seriously this game gets a huge Grumpy 10/10. Its relaxing, thought provoking, and very very user friendly.All the technical  rig ma role you guys seem to want to know about, after an initial hiccup you smarty pants people will be satisfied with the production. worth the money Buy it",1

138102644,1159690,Great game about kraft and train travel with beautiful graphics and not an ordinary plot. I recommend it to everyone!!!,1
138102619,1159690,"Ok I've seen the reviews on this and they seem to be pretty polarising. I'll try to be as fair and balanced as possible having played it for a couple of hours.  Pro's  - Looks good, stylised but I like it. - Similar to Raft mechanically while different enough to not be samey. - Great potential. - Only played for a couple of hours but no bugs, which for a game only a couple of hours old is impressive (though apparently it's been out awhile on Epic games which will be addressed in cons)  Con's  - Allegedly the developers did an exclusivity deal with epic, and I think by now everyone knows how the epiccp store is to a healthy market what a throbbing tumor is to a health body....though lacking the charm or moral fibre. - Research 'tree' is not a tree it's a line at least as far as I played there is no chance to prioritise early it's just do A then B then C etc. No choice to focus building a cooking station before containers for example, hoping this is less a problems later in game but first impressions wise, it's not good. - Apparently you need to use epic games services for multi player (haven't tried it yet) this is more of a result in being built in Unreal I suspect, which seems like more of a reason to not use unreal to build your game. - Also apparently if you get dc'd or leave the multiplayer game you lose all items, I can't confirm or deny at this point but if true needs to be fixed immediately that is enough to kill a resource gathering game. (this however was supposedly hotfixed today (10/05/23) so if that's fixed it's a good start.  At the time of this I'd give the game a 6.5/10 for your average gamer and 7/10 for raft style enthusiasts, the developers get  4/10, 1 for games issues and working with epic's current business model you deserve to lose 5 points from your rating but at least it's not your social credit score.  I will update this as I play more and once I've tried multiplayer.",1
138102577,1159690,"People complaining about the most miniscule things. Yes it's unfinished, it's Early Access ffs. Some negative reviews even stating things that just aren't true.",1
138102203,1159690,"The game provides some pretty exciting and interesting gameplay. It's fun to play, and I don't need more than that. Nevertheless, I am familiar with the negative reviews about it and some of the comments I think are fair. Play it and make up your own opinion.",1

138101811,1159690,"Absolute waste of time, I understand its early release but still. Extremely buggy, barely any game play, copy and pasted structures... not even close to what its priced as. One of the worst games I've played this year. So much down time doing nothing, and the shark in the game is a joke, the only real threat is barely around and barely a threat. They did advertise one thing right, the game is absolutely VOID of any fun.",0
138101771,1159690,Love the style and idea. Quite peaceful to start out and nicely chilled. I haven't got too far yet but i'm enjoying the Void itself and I love being able to both jump off into it and collect things and also disembark and explore as well. Good Stuff! I hope that maybe NPC crew members can be implemented at some point to help run/defend the train as well if you don't fancy co op. Look forward to the next update!,1

138101282,1159690,"The tutorial takes 2 hours to complete. You cannot play multiplayer until you finish the tutorial. The tutorial is a pointless, boring grind with progression that makes no sense, and objectives which are gated entirely behind RNG. I decided to watch late tier gameplay to see what all this would amount to and lo, it's just more of the same, but on a bigger train. The only objective is loot, craft, and the train moves on. There's no point, and if the setting doesn't thrill you, no fun either.",0

138100680,2229260,"I played this as a kid in 2011 CB for literal years. This was my First MMO.  Its now 2023, The game itself is still good.  The company who made the game re-launched it on a global scale.   They have had Moderators Threaten Trojans against the community.  Released the game with Gold duping and exploits. Eternal Point Duping ( form of cash shop currency for the free tab)  Elected a Known Exploiter to be a Game sage in the community under X-Legends.   They have muted and shadow banned people for MONTHS up to release and now during release.   Failure to fix bugs over the course of a week.   Lack of communication.  Increased item mall rates compared to original.   Its a good thing theres D4 next month. Shame to see a classic MMO that so many love and enjoy ruined by Chinese pride and ignorance.",0

138104815,1230170,Definitely fun and addicting if you enjoy these simulation style games. Hopefully there are many more guns and attachments with the full release.,1
138104199,1230170,I have been waiting for this game for about a year now and i got to say its great so far! cant wait till i can build more!,1

138100538,1230170,Consider me impressed. Im really hyped for the full game :D,1
138100086,1230170,"Sad that it took years for this demo to come out. Unfortunately, this game was made by people who live in a country that heavily restricts firearms, so the developers have almost no way of actually knowing anything about the subject matter. The game has little to do with actual gunsmithing and is more of a menial labor simulator. The actual gunsmithing is mostly automated and the game just has you disassembling parts to clean them.  The gameplay loop is uninteresting, tedious and boring.",0
138099909,1230170,"Played the prologue through, and it ate an hour of my day up, nicely. If you're a gun-nut like myself, and/or just enjoy tinkering & sims, this is gonna be a win. I'm stoked to see the final version, and mag-dump endless hours into it. The ""demo"" ran flawlessly for me, with zero issues. Hoping to get picked for early access play-time, past the demo, because i could do this all day. Regardless, I cant wait for more.",1
138104581,758690,"What is this buggy mess? Why does my Character just instantly die if I run over a lego brick? Then i spawn into a death loop, resulting in exiting the game so I can restart the mission.  Whats going on here? Movement is janky, Inventory is a mess (WHY THE HELL DO I KEEP DROPPING ITEMS IF I PICK THEM UP WHILE HAVING A TOOL EQUIPPED?!) Basics are missing, cant comment on the progression since I havent had the nerve to finish the intro. Should not have released this now. Wait a year until its polished",0
138104046,758690,"Elon musks kid is the AI and Asus ROG managed to cater the computers on Mars somehow...  A bit janky and minor bugs in my short playthrough, will update as I keep going, but first impressions it's alright, I'll give it a neutral rating for the time being. The brightness/lighting was really bad but it was fixed quickly by switching display mode from ""Fullscreen Windowed"" to ""Exclusive Fullscreen"", and performance was good in general.   Note, I ran this on RTX 3080, 12th gen i7, 32gb ram blah blah, so last gen high specs, so based on other reviews, if you're running on specs below this, just be wary.",1
138103633,758690,"Complete and utter garbage. In 75 minutes I encountered more than 30 bugs.  Game is very clunky, not immersive at all. Campaign is terrible, animations are very very bad. Audio is bad. Gameplay mechanics are nicely thought of but executed very very poorly with sooo many bugs and glitches. It runs but it is unplayable. very frustrating game. Also very very annoying airlocks. ""pressure stabilizing"" or whatever every 10 seconds. Third person view comes back with every action you do so you have to press V again to go back to Fist Person. The Demo was cool, but this game is like someone else remade the game and made it terrible. Sooo disappointing.  I get it small team, low budget, Early Access. But then still this is not even worth 5 euro.",0
138103598,758690,"Great Game, Nice Developers, suprisingly few bugs at launch",1
138103337,758690,"Horrible graphics. Awful framerates even on Very Low settings. The tutorial treats you like you've never used a computer before. The campaign starts very slow and with a lot of cringy, boring voiceacting. Dude, just let me play and build stuff. I eventually gave up after an explosion pushed me away and locked me inside of another object, unable to move. I couldn't find an ""Unstuck"" button in the options.   Idk, maybe I just got unlucky and impatient. There's definitely a potential here for something decent, looking at the pictures/videos. They just need to patch up the core game to make it at least somewhat playable...I'll give it another try in couple of months maybe.",0
138102841,758690,Great job,1
138102815,758690,As expected for an early access game. Waiting this game for a long time good job !,1
138102766,758690,"Besides the idea, there isn't a single good thing about this game, not the graphics, soundtrack, playability, visuals, nothing is enjoyable. The game has a very slow pace compared to my espectations, since it is a survival game maybe it should take inspiration in great games from the same genre. Interactions are way too slow and movement gives you little fine control,  The interface color scheme is bland and tedious, it's basically blue everywhere,  The tutorial is BEYOND boring and does an awful job explaining the basics and couldn't keep me engaged . overall a terrible experience. Even if there was multiplayer/coop I don't think I could overlook such screaming problems",0
138104268,2364090,"Pretty awesome game! They did an incredible job with everything, and it came together really well. I did get jump scared multiple times even though I told myself I wasn't going to lol. Fantastic job!  p.s loved the lil guys :)",1
138104655,1375900,"good project, thx",1
138103026,1375900,"Unfortunately in the state it is in, it is not a wholly fulfilling experience.  I believe the base idea and execution is well done, however it is very limited as of now.  My major problem is just how there is very little difficulty on the game until you get caught out in a bad position and die instantly from full health with nearly nothing to do once you recognise your error.  This to me simply is a kink the game play that needs to be ironed out, by adding something like a dash or other abilities that let you mitigate theses errors.  The fact that 80% of my runs end suddenly doesn't make me feel like i need to get better at the game, but more just have a better spawn RNG.    If i lose in a roguelike, i want it to feel like it was my fault.  This game doesn't do that, or does so in a way that makes me want to stop playing rather than go for another run.",0

138105037,1742020,No one's gonna see this review so I'll say it's still better than the steaming pile of GARBAZO BEANS STRIVE! For a F2P fighter the game plays better than most games (appealing to mass) trying to simplify controls and auto combo trash.,1

138105720,1159690,"Something similar to Raft, The Forest but in steampunk. I liked it, will wait for the full game to come out  Yes it's a linear game like Half-Life, but what's wrong with that?  You should definitely try  [b] 8/10",1
138105210,1159690,owsome game,1
138105200,1159690,"Similarity with Raft, but at times better, I love such games, I'm waiting for a friend to buy and let's go to play in a co-op",1
138105047,1159690,"Alot of these reviews are vague.  Do you like the hook in Raft? Do you like swimming like Subnautica? Do you like Borderlands Combat/ Loot (but parts instead of full guns)? How about it's Narration? Do you like the Valheim Idea that food is a bonus, not a necessity? How about the research progression from Satisfactory?  Well I hope youre answering ""Yes"" to all of these because this is this game.  Im 7 gates in, and 10 hrs in. I have crawled to here. Never ONCE giving the train speed.  So Keep in mind, I know there is more.  But these key concepts NEED to please you because they are the loop. you gather stuff to customise your stuff to gather stuff to customise and upgrade more. Im BIG into these types of games, and this one has a style. It gets really calm, it gets exciting and the FPS portions are not hard. But for the most part you'll be floating around the train grappling resources as your bud is cooking the last of the Organic wasting all the wood.  Cant wait to see how ""enemy trains"" are gonna work. Really could use like canons...or something.",1
138104643,1159690,"While I do personally recommend this game, I will make several notes below to hopefully help you decide whether to get the game.  1: If you WANT to play this game and you WANT to enjoy this game, even through its flaws you will enjoy it. Pick it up now, it'll most likely only improve with time.  2: If you're playing SOLO, you will likely have a BETTER time than multiplayer. Most of the bugs myself and my friend have been experiencing are on my friend's side only, of which I'm hosting. It's not unplayable by any means, but be ready to be on their discord offering bug reports at a not infrequent rate. From what I've seen in their hotfix notes as well, they are both working on it and it seems to be partially a ping issue.  3: If you are moreso considering the game because you have a friend who wants to play it, this might not be the best time for you. This ties a lot into point 2, where because the game's more buggy for people joining a lobby, you may struggle to find the game as fun as your compatriot(s). Come back in a month or two when more of the bugs are ironed out and consider it then.  Other than that, if you enjoyed games like Raft, you should enjoy this game. The combat's fun, resource gathering, while slow at some points, has fairly good methods of progression (USE YOUR WORKBENCH, GET RANK 10!), and in general the game is graphically beautiful even for someone like me running entirely on medium graphics. Gunplay, while not as clean as your halo or your CoD, is still solid, and if you like customization or Borderland's rarity system, prepare for dopamine. The Narrator is a fantastic tutorial character, who enhances your tutorial experiences rather than hindering them. Tutorials also are paired with text based prompts, which also allow you to skip them, as well as going away on their own after a timer. Very good QoL feature. The pistol is also a very fun tool, being an infinite ammo tool that makes ammo more of a fun addition rather than a resource problem.  Overall, I enjoy the game. Please use my tips above to decide whether you should spring now or later, but regardless, I'm going to go have fun with my AR, I got a new blue stock! :D",1
138104558,1159690,"Visually, the game really liked the first couple, an interesting style of play, to play in co-op will be more interesting in double, but also to relax in the moment one can also.  10 trains out of 10",1
138104492,1159690,"Voidtrain is a fantastic game that offers a unique blend of exploration, crafting, and combat in a beautifully crafted world. The game's mechanics are intuitive and the controls are smooth, making it easy to jump in and start playing. The visuals and sound design are top-notch, creating an immersive and captivating experience. I especially enjoyed the train-building aspect of the game, which adds a layer of strategy and customization to the gameplay. Overall, Voidtrain is a must-play for anyone looking for a fun and engaging adventure in a stunningly crafted world.",1

Each time i go through a gate, i am excited to see what me and the narrator will find next. Game does a good job of keeping it feeling like a sandbox, crafting, customizing, base builder. While providing an actual linear campaign. It feels like there is always something new. I highly recommend, its a good game. Worth your time. Hard to believe its still classified as early access. I have never seen an Early access game so well polished, or of late AAA titles. Great job to the Devs.",1

138105733,1582380,"As of now, I wouldn't recommend this; it's rough. Combat and the visuals are my biggest complaints; waiting there until an enemy decides to use an attack that you can use back on them is annoying. If they were a little quicker with this, I'd maybe feel better about it but it just feels awkward running around an arena for 10 minutes doing little to no damage.  Love the art style, but there's way too much going on visually in some of the areas and it all blends together.  I feel bad not recommending it, but it's clear they've got a lot to do in Early Access before I'd change this. I backed this on Kickstarter and don't regret supporting an indie team, but think it needed more time before this release.",0

138105745,758690,"I didn't run into many bugs, just horrible game design. Nobody was waiting for this game for some janky, poorly thought out ""adventure"" campaign with poor feed back, death loops and escape missions.

Are there bugs, yes there are... this is an EA game and people need to remember that.

138108666,1940340,"I'm going to start off and say that it's definitely not worth 40 bucks. If you're a fan of roguelites, enjoyed the combat but not the grind of DD1, and own DD1 on steam the 30 dollar price point isn't horrible but it's still quite a bit. I would say I tentatively recommend this game because on one hand it's the most fun I've had with a roguelite in a while but on the other hand there's so many small issues that I personally dislike that can make the game very unfun to play at times.   The big one is definitely the relationship system. I think that it's a decent idea but the fact that if you happen to roll a negative relationship it locks your skills is annoying to say the least. I get that it adds to the challenge but it also just makes the game unfun to play because it takes away choices from the player. The devs need to either rework it or add an option to disable it completely IMO.   Combat and travel is also just way too slow. I'd go as far as to say that the game is unplayable without cheat engine or wemod or something to speed the game up. DD1 also had the same issue and it's sad that they haven't learned from that. Once again the devs need to have an option to speed the game up at least.   I think the biggest thing that the devs need to focus on is mod support because QoL mods will fix the vast majority of problems that I have with this game.",1

138108390,1940340,"A fully complete, impressive, and functioning game at launch  Strangely, that's a surprising thing for a lot of games I play these days, but aside from the fact that I can play and not run into several bugs it is a phenomenal game! They take crucial details from the first game and put a wonderful spin on them. It really pulls you into the story of each character and the nature of the horror itself. I find myself continuously astounded of how good a job they did on design as well; every bit is well animated and exciting.  Much like the first game, it takes a second to get used to the changes in mechanics because its complex and intricate, but combat is fun much like in DD. They music is superb and I can't wait for it to release on streaming services.  The story is dark and mysterious (I was very curious what they were going to do for it, like if you are still on the estate) and it's not just like you are buying a large dlc for the first game or a revamped DD. No, this is a whole story and it's wonderful. Serious applause to the developers on this one.  Well worth the 40 bucks I spent on it; such a fantastic and difficult game (tough there are ways to make it easier if you so desire)!",1

There's been a couple of issues upon release that affect core gameplay, but the developers have been pretty quick to sort it out. There may be some more down the road so it may be something to wait another few days on before hopping onto it immediately. Those of us who bought it right away can probably find most remaining issues, if there are any.  The comparison to Dorfromatiks is a common one, and I can see that. I also would compare the play style and mood to Islanders. Rather than putting buildings down, you're putting plots down. Relaxing and can play short games if you want.",1
138106276,1730250,"A relaxing puzzle game in the same style as Dorfromantik, though a bit easier to get into.  Pros:  + Fun, whimsical art style + Simple puzzle of matching terrain/biomes together to build a world + Unique and interesting structures  + Animated features add life to the world you make (Zepplins in the air, butterflies and frogs in the ponds) + Generally good music, can get a bit repetitive  + Easier to get going and not fail compared to Dorfromantik + Cats seem to be the inhabitants of this world, driving the tractors and boats and living in the houses + Can save your game and come back later   Cons:   - Some features do not seem to make sense (Example: A lake with a quest requiring 1 water tile, however placing a water tile in that spot disqualifies the quest without explanation as to why that water tile is not suitable)  In regards to Dorfromantik, having played both:  This one is definitely easier, and has a bit more 'life' to it with the zeppelins floating around, etc  They're similar games but i think functionally different enough. Dorfromantik is more challenging and a LOT more reliant on proper, perfect placement in order to keep going, while this one feels a bit more suitable for a more casual, relaxing time when you don't want to spend 15 minutes debating on where to put a tile or risk game over  Dorfromantik is a bit simpler visually, but has unique tiles/biomes like the train tracks and rivers, while this one feels more rich in terms of visuals and has a lot of unique buildings that buff surrounding area. THe quests in both are quite different as well",1

The cartoony graphics defiantly take away from the horor, but that doesn't make it less intense, walking through the woods, to have the wendigo pop out at you will always be a rush!   The sound design is enjoyable, especially the fire arm sounds, (however the player ""hmm"" whenever you inspect an item, gets old REALLY fast. I am not a minecraft villager XD)   So far we played the camping grounds map, and the Snowy Village map, both are unique and different from eachother, I loved the open forest, and where as the village felt smaller and more liner it fit perfectly! I loved them both!  Overall, this was a very fun evening, and we will be going back to fight the other two monsters! I can garuntee, if you add more maps and monsters we will be sticking around!

138108117,1159690,"The game has stunning graphics, with beautiful landscapes and intricate details in the train's design. The storyline is intriguing, with the player tasked to explore the train and uncover the secrets of the alternate dimension. The game also has a survival aspect, where players must manage their resources and avoid dangers on the train.   However, the game can be quite difficult, and some players may find the survival aspect frustrating. Additionally, the game's mechanics can feel clunky at times, and the controls may take some getting used to. Overall, Voidtrain is a unique and enjoyable experience for players who enjoy survival games with a twist.",1

For the price I'd say it's worth a try for most people and if you don''t like it you'll know well within the 2 hour steam refund period.",1
138107946,1159690,"The game itself is interesting. The art style and art direction are fantastic and it all looks great, and so far i do genuinely like the game so far, but there are some macro and micro issues that must be addressed.  Micro: The game is very buggy and generally unpolished (It's early access so this is expected, but i still hope these things eventually get buffed out).   Some of the glitches include getting stuck on the hand crank not even 10 minutes into the tutorial< visual glitches with backpacks and menus, soldier outposts sometimes just not activating and staying in an unloaded state, and worst of all, guns and items clipping into the ground upon death making it impossible to recover (not just resources, but grappling hooks and guns. I've already lost 3 guns i was working on to this glitch. Please fix this one first it is unironically game-ruining)  What i mean by unpolished is that many aspects of the game just don't feel great to interact with. The game has an obsession with animations for most actions (which to be fair do look very good). The problem with this is that almost every action you can perform takes forever to finish. Want to switch weapons? It takes a full second to do that. Want to build something? It takes over a second for your character to pull out his hammer. Was that not the menu you wanted? Well wait for your character to do the animation for putting the hammer away and continue with the long animation for the menu you wanted. Overall this feature does make the game look cool and probably is fun for the YouTube/Twitch viewer, it makes the game feel sometimes unbearably slow to play, especially in high intensity scenarios like shootouts.  Other aspect i wish could be more polished is the menus. This is a survival crafting game with some of the most unintuitive menu system I've ever seen. Not only do you have to click through multiple submenus just to get to the one basic part you want to craft, but also many of these menus do not have any sound effects yet making it very difficult to tell if you did it correctly, especially in the early game. Also if you need to craft an item in order to craft a different item, (Example needing to craft chemicals in order to craft grease), you must navigate the menus, craft the right item, go out of all the menus, collect the item, go back into the menus, and only then actually craft the item you need. The fact that the menu system feels clunky despite the fact you spend so much time of this game in the menus crafting items to progress is quite unfortunate. They do eventually get easier to navigate a few hours in once you get used to them, but it still feels aggravating in those beginning stages  This is a smaller gripe compared to the other sections but the player's feet always have their hitbox active making it very annoying to get back onto the train especially from the back, and the fact that this is the way the game orients you after ""holding F to pull up to the train"" feels bad.  Macro: Despite what i said in the previous part of this review, i am enjoying my time in the game so far> However in my opinion, the game doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. On one hand it wants to be a survival game in the style of Raft, however hunger is not really that vital of a system, dying has little punishment, and the enemies in the void are uncommon encounters and are not difficult to deal with, and frankly the void feels like something is missing most of the time.  On the other hand, the gun combat with the soldiers is actually rather fun, the soldier AI is impressive and fun, (They have the ability to weave behind cover and work together with other soldiers to flank you), and the act of jury-rigging guns together from scrap pieces is satisfying, however the gunplay side of the game is sprinkled in as small chunks while the majority of the time is spent resource gathering the same basic materials in the mostly empty void.  What i would like to see in the game would be at least a game-mode with a much higher difficulty spike. Imagine tracking along through the void where sharks and enemies are spawning like crazy and are more dangerous, floating off the train to fish resources is a calculated risk, managing resource gathering with fighting enemies and repairing the train. This would give an actual use to the train's ability to speed through the level, making the enemies easier to fight, but resources harder to get, or picking the level clean would be a strategy, but allow the enemies to swarm you. Every station platform would be a sigh of relief instead of a slow inevitability. Maybe increasing the likelihood of random events like train on train fights or soldier outposts to ad to the variety. Basically the combat is more fun than the resource gathering so imagine if the game was more ""Sea of Thieves"" and less ""Raft""  Overall, the game's presentation and atmosphere and art direction are great. The game feels like it has a ton of potential to become amazing once it finds it's footing and fixes the bugs. I am enjoying it so far and will probably keep an eye on it as it develops, but in it's current form i cannon recommend anyone pay 30 dollars for it. Let's hope this game continues to build upon it's great premise.",0

138107581,1159690,"Haven't gotten too far into it, but so far it seems pretty competent. Performance is fine on my system (still have a gtx970 because the card market is an overpriced hellscape now) and haven't encountered any major issues. Sometimes items will clip into the ground slightly and not be retrievable by hand, but the grapple gun's pretty strong so it can grab that stuff still. While doing co-op with a friend who was host, I also had a load in issue at one of the major depot stops, just had to jump out and back in.  There's some minor issues here and there with the actual game flow. Early on we're a bit resource starved, the crates don't store a lot. Some areas can be a bit dark and there's no lantern to help light it up to make sure we aren't missing slot machine coins and whatnot, the stuff that doesn't glow or have a beacon. I'm sure this will get smoothed out as time passes, the game just launched on steam in early access. I don't really give a shit whether it's been out on other platforms or not, they can have whatever poor quality standards they want. As a steam release, the state of the game is currently fine.  Regarding the epic shit that gets installed, I'm not thrilled about it, but it appears to be a bare bones version that exists strictly for matchmaking and cross platform connectivity. And unfortunately this standard has been around for nearly a decade now thanks to EA and ubisoft, so oh well.  If I encounter any major issues I'll update this review, but if you're on the fence about the game, know that it's currently in a good state.

It doesn't seem to be a fast moving game, but... that's kind of what games like this are supposed to be like. It's a simulator more than an action survival game. If you want to punch Martians, there's other options.  Are there things that need improving? Definitely, see Access, Early - movement speed is on the slower side, there's some sound issues I'd prefer tweaked such as voices being too quiet compared to other sounds and no immediate way to fix, and some of the actions are on the slower or fiddlier side. But those also seem things that can be fixed.",1

Almost all youtube vids i have seen say tha same, that the prologue, especially the end of it, is horrible. The developers will loose many players due to it, that will demand a refund.

Also the focus on tokens to add buffs to your party or debuffs to the enemy is a really good change, you have more of a say in the direction of a combat than the first game I feel.  The original still exists and isn't made irrelevant by the sequel, apparently that is a big problem to some people. Idk, I think both games having their own identity while still having the darkest dungeon tone is a good thing.

The switch to 3D is almost assuredly going to stifle the modding community.  Just for clarity, if the original was a solid 10/10, this would be an 8/10.

The sounds effects are annoying, opening and closing the building menu takes too much time, I feel no sense of direction and I'm literally going in ONE DIRECTION. I can't find any joy playing this in the first hour and that is a dead give away that it isn't going to be any fun for me.",0

138109850,1159690,"I recently played Void Express and found the train-building mechanics and customization options to be interesting. Combat was challenging and satisfying, although it could feel repetitive. The game's world was visually stunning, but some locations lacked depth. Overall, it was a decent adventure game experience",1
138109830,1159690,"The best novelty of May 2023, the game is made very beautifully, as well as not the usual gameplay. You just take a closer look at the landscapes in the game and the monsters and you will want to explore all this)",1

138111401,2229260,"I played Eden Eternal back in 2012 and loved it. The colorful graphics, the unique class system, and the ability to switch classes on the go made the game stand out from other MMORPGs. When I heard that it was being relaunched, I was excited to jump back in and relive my fond memories.  However, the relaunch was rushed and it's clear that the game wasn't ready to be released. There are numerous bugs and other problems that make playing the game frustrating at times. The servers have stability issues, which lead to frequent disconnections and maintenance. There are many graphical glitches that take away from the game's aesthetic appeal.   One issue that has become very obvious to me as I continue to play Eden Eternal is that X-legend seems to be more focused on monetization than fixing the game's technical issues. The leveling system has been rushed, and it feels like the priority is for players to buy items from the item mall rather than providing a balanced and enjoyable gameplay experience. It's frustrating to see the game's potential being held back by these decisions. While I understand that companies need to make money, it's disheartening to see X-legend prioritize short-term profit over long-term success.   The game has so much potential, and with some proper attention and care, it could be a truly great MMORPG. Also, I have noticed that X-legend seems to be treating Eden Eternal as a race, rather than a game meant for players to enjoy at their own pace. This mentality is frustrating, as it detracts from the overall experience of the game. Players should be able to explore and enjoy the world of Eden Eternal at their own pace.  In conclusion, I would recommend Eden Eternal to anyone who played and loved it in the past, but with the fact that the relaunch has some serious issues that need to be fixed. If you're a new player, it might be best to wait until the bugs and other problems have been ironed out before jumping in.",0
138111077,2138570,"The game's fun and thats the most important factor. I love the original mutants: genetic gladiators so its great to see this game here on steam instead of facebook games. (I wish they moved here as well) Anyway MG looks promising, ther is a lot bugs to fix it misses many features wich is expected considering the fact that its early beta. Also reedem this cod RBOOSTMG01 for free something i dont know what cause there was no animation of what i get and didnt see what changed. So i guess thats all and play mgg as well",1

138111244,758690,"It's not often i write reviews let alone refund games, however i think this one is missing the mark it a little to early for ea. i started off with the campaign, it was so painful, then getting stuck after the opening disaster and it having no fluid flow was it for me.  animations are terrible and some textures are so bad. everything feels so clunky and a chore to do. yes i know its ea but at least get the first 30-40 mins of game play palatable. first impressions are everything and i'm afraid its not a good one for now. perhaps a return in a year or so as the idea is sound. just delivered poorly for now.",0
138110590,758690,"Great first impressions with the game , love the idea , better than most first releases into EARLY ACCESS , even contains a tutorial , and progression which most don’t , looking forward to seeing this game progress .  The odd bug here, there but best first impressions and experience with a early access game on day zero  Thanks devs",1
138110421,758690,The idea is there but the execution is way off. Not only is it poorly optimized but the character models look like they are from the early 2000s. I really wanted to like the game but the controls are so janky it's not even fun to move around. Hopefully it gets better with time.,0
138110378,758690,Best planet survival game,1
138110351,758690,Ummm Cant play the game at all I use a touch pad for my mouse and its not working the game needs to be full controller support. I will be returning the game until the DEVS get this game together So disappointed that it also isn't multi-player or co-op Come on DEVS make this game great The programmers need to play the full game on a download from steam,1
138110041,758690,"Has the ability to become a great game. There are things to be worked on and bugs to be squashed but that's what early access is all about. Be warned though. This isn't an arcade game and there isn't much hand holding. Your going to have to work out a lot of stuff, just like.....I don't know....maybe you were stranded on Mars or something.",1
138109981,758690,"So this game is getting a no from me, for now. That said, I'm not going to refund the game because it has potential (Legit left it to a roll of the dice), and i'm hoping over it's time in EA it will see some improvements.  Most all of my time in game, so far was doing the campaign. Wasn't a positive experience. The tutorials don't give you near the information you need (There always seem to be more parts, and more to what they quickly had you do), and navigation in general is pretty poor (Even more so in the game itself. The map and way-point system need some tl&c). I had to stop on the tutorial about dumping resources as I couldn't progress past getting my vehicle on the platform, not sure if I was doing something wrong or it's bugged but nowhere on the controls was the option to dump, and in general it did a poor job with it's description.  I moved on to the main campaign and let me tell you... that prologue was a nightmare. It seemed like a half baked tutorial. (The poor control and inventory management made it far worse). Then along comes this disaster of an escape sequence. That was a huge headache that almost managed to do something that hasn't happened to me since childhood, rage quit. Poorly marked path + terrible way-points + very hard to read map = ugh. I attempted that escape 15 or so odd times before I finally accidentally found an object to interact with that opened up a path out.  I should also point out that the inventory and control scheme is... frustrating in it's current state. 9 times out of 10 I ended up dropping something I was trying to put away, or just having it randomly drop.... it just needs some help. (Side note: The process of removing the helmet is super annoying)  Now I can't say much past that as the game does a poor job at breaking things down after that. I understand it's a survival game but I feel like under a game mode called campaign you need some kind of direction that's more than ""Here, read through this ton of information and figure it out""  I'm going to spend a bit of time in the sandbox mode just to get something from this game for now.  All in all, in it's current state it's not worth the price. That being said, it's early access and the game could turn into something great. It's a gamble.",0
138109105,758690,"I was really excited about this one and I still am (I hope it will be fixed soon). The main issue that I have with it is the FPS... My PC's way over the recommended and I can barely get about 30-40 FPS... The optimisation is soooo bad :( I'll update my review once the game gets fixed... Right now, I don't recommend this game to anyone.",0
138109027,758690,"saying  ""great game"" and all that would be a lie... also shitting on the game just for fun like all the others .. would be a lie too...   it runs fine on max setting 1080p on my rig (which is not a bad one tbh)  the tutorial is a little bit ... stretching.... just to kick u in the ass all of a sudden   i died several times without knowing (maybe a bug it looked like i broke my ankle and i died)  everyone who says its slow and clunky and whatnot... this game ""prides"" itself to be fairly technical what would be a statement regarding realism.... and i bet on a different planet with less atmospheric pressure and less gravity .. we would certainly move slower..  but im not handing out roses only...  certain indicators would be nice like outdoor temp while im sitting in the capsule helping players is always nice but auto-placing a well blueprint right next to the capsule in the campaign the second u land  makes no sense at all since there is no water at all....  unlike at the spot 150 meter away  also the sound keeps tapping out.... like in the ""in-game"" sequence which shows the Campaign escape rocket and the subsequent reentry phase  Music is way to loud but placing it below 10% shuts the music off completely sometimes  things are self explanatory but a ""hint"" would be nice i placed an Airlock on my Workshop and after connecting Oxygen to it i blew out my Brain by opening the Door.... the game tried to Equalize the indoor pressure with the martian atmosphere  so .... guess what u need 2 Airlock Frames.... go figure ^^  also the character looks awful in Third Person... hovering 360 degrees like M.J. on crack sidesteps would be nice... also it ""feels"" like there is no weight at all to either my Character or any of the Objects i interact with ....  for an Early Access.. u guys  ... honestly ... u kicked the Bucket full of turds in our faces.... it should have been way better than this ....  but .. u know there are a number of games which presented and even shiftier product and sold it to us as EarlyAccess..  keep up the work.... i believe in u guys ;) ^^  Advertised Product 9/10 current EA State  5/10 ;(   recommend only if u are a Hard-Scifi enthusiast otherwise wait or move to something else",1

It's reminiscent to 20 Minutes Till Dawn with a mining mechanic and skill cooldown instead of active reload.  I'm not sure if time or mining progression increases run difficulty (I think it's the latter), but the goal is not bound to the clock as runs can be completed in varying lengths of time; this puts this game miles ahead of most other horde survival games for me.",1

Cons 1,To big of changes away from the first, much much preferred the dungeon crawling of the first. If the cart was just a new mode I'd be fine but completely getting ride of the dungeons is weird the game is called darkest DUNGEON! 2. Feels like death don't mater. In the original you didn't want a hero to die because you felt attached. Thats what made the first so remember-able. This game toes it out of the window. Now you die no biggy just start over..... Now the series feels like every other roguelite making it no longer stand out 3. No more Base improvements 4. Not enough new Heroes. taking the old game into consideration you think they'd just add more ontop of the existing heros. nope. They threw one out and only add one.... Very odd. There hundreds of mods out there that add heores for the old game that could of given them ideas. My guess..... they just want to sell them to you down the road.  5. No controler support  Pros.  1 3d is actually very nice. I honestly didn't think i'd like it but i did! 2. combat is much smother, simplified but also more deep. Very good improvements in the actual combat sense 3. I like the relationship system. It's great to see them interact! 4. much more enemy variation. if only they did the same for the heroes.   Overall its very fun game but somethings just feel like a step back and make the game stand out less. if you took the combat of this one the relationships, 3d graphic, and enemy variety and just had put it on darkest dungeons 1's maps and game style this would easily of been a 10/10. as of right now its a not recommend just play the first",0

It's short, and my word would I love to play more levels, and learn more. That's not a criticism, for under £1, it punches beyond its price. It's a game that'll stick with me, and I'll definitely follow this developer in the future! :)  (Also the sound design was a really lovely touch, it made the game feel so peaceful in the face of what's normally portrayed as a scary thing)",1

138115776,2055910,Just One More Game! You will find yourself saying this over and over as you play this fun and addictive arcade chaser. An excellent game at a reasonable price. It's no Fallopian Frenzy but it is a quality game.,1
138115759,1940340,"I think about 70% yes on this game.  This feels like a lite version of DD1, but was still enjoyable.  Considering how many games I end up playing for less than 10 hours, this game should probably be considered worth my money.  I made it to the end in about 15 hours.  But TBH, it felt anti-climatic and I'm kind of meh on trying another run.  When I beat it, I was surprised that it was really the end, even though I knew there were three sections total.  I think the game is pretty fun.  It doesn't feel nearly as punishing as DD1.  This game kinda makes me want to try that game again.  Maybe this is a gateway game to make me forget how stressful DD1 felt playing :)  Edit:  I should mention that characters dying makes no difference.  The run just ends when they are all dead and the same characters can be picked for the next run if you wish.  As of the release, there are a couple of UI oddities before a run starts, but nothing that breaks anything.    Graphics are good, voice acting is great (I believe the same guy as in DD1)  I'm comparing this game to other rogue-likes like Slay the Spire, Enter the Gungeon, Hades, Dead Cells. In comparison, this game just feels so much shorter and less fulfilling.  Maybe the developers just balanced as a low difficulty and the real gameplay is behind the difficulty modifiers that can be unlocked.  Maybe they felt that having more characters to choose from would entice players to play more than one playthrough.  I would really like it if there was a ""hold to speed up"" button like ShowGunners has.  At a minimum, there should probably be speed hotkeys or flat animation speed increase.  It wasn't until the latter hours of the gameplay that the combat felt predictable enough to want the animations to be sped up.  Cheat Engine's Speedhack does work as long as Vsync is disabled.",1

138115460,1940340,It's not like the first one in many ways but it's pretty fun regardless! Could definitely add in more characters and make it where when your characters die you have to get new ones instead of just restarting on the old.,1
138115445,1940340,The sequel to the best game of all time. Different and fun enough to exist perfectly alongside DD1. I see myself going back and forth between playing these games for many many many more years.,1
138115385,1940340,"The game itself is not that bad, but it definitely doesn't live up to DD1. Everything that made the first game great is gone, I get it they tried something new and it's okay! But they should've made this a spin-off, the game is beautifull and well crafted but it's just bland, story and gameplaywise. There isn't much depth in the area's, the characters can die and respawn there isn't much to do. Even though DD1 was full of grind, the reason I kept playing was because pushing forward ment better gear and better gear ment keeping your characters alive. In this game you 'complete a run' and loose all your trinkets, character progress (strengths, weaknesses), basically all your loot and then start over. This is quite boring and doesn't offer a great challenge. There is so much missing sadly.  So be aware when buying this game! It is a solid game, but absolutely nothing like Darkest Dungeon 1! I would've refunded, I was hoping there was more after the first few hours, but there wasn't. It's just the same gameplay loop and it gets boring pretty fast. I will probably finish it, but I would not recommend the game.",0

The art style is beautiful; the 3d visuals show the world in a way that the first one couldn't. The first game was a masterpiece, and I believe this game will also be remembered a masterpiece, because the changes from the first one are for the better, no one wants to play the same game twice, and DD2 brings a new, fresh, and fun experience for fans of the first game.",1

The demo was way challenging--I struggled to get 10 of the 16 buildings they had unlocked for it--while this first game I'm playing through hasn't really stymied me yet at 42/52 buildings and ~80 tiles left. Might just take some time to get the challenge just right, or it might just be that kind of game. If the difficulty never changed, then it's still well worth the money for the guided creations you're doing.  Similar but different enough to Dorfromantik.

It's great to see that the game already has lots of items and weapons, and also has a story to follow on each map to have something todo while hunting down the monster(s).  There are only a couple of bugs at the time of this review that were a bit annoying, and that was around the ATVs. My friend and I weren't able to turn them very well, and they flip easily, and if you get out of the ATV while it's flipped you either die or go through the map.  Other than getting the vehicle side of things fixed the only other things I'd like to see would be achievements and maybe a better inventory system when it comes to separation of what each item does and not being able to pickup more than 10 different items so it doesn't confuse people. But allow the player to find bigger backpacks to pickup more than 10 items overtime  Overall great game.

Have a tiny bit of the palm of your hand on the surface? That counts as gripping it. - The game only has icons for the Oculus Quest.

138115297,758690,"So far I'm having a blast!  Yes, there are EA hiccups. And the end of campaign intro can be tough! Hint: Follow the green lights on the floor. Be prepared to run, jump, crouch, and push things out of the way.   Once you get past the ""tutorial"" section of the campaign, your first order of business should be to find water. Use the Spectral ""gizmo"" in your assortment of tools you are given.   You get more blueprints with tech points. You get more tech points by using a skill. For example: Use your grinder to scrap down useless boxes, etc. to get experience in Materials. Your first tech point in materials will allow you to build a workshop. Build solar panels for electrical experience, and so on.   The game is sadly not that intuitive when it goes about telling you how to do things. The first few ""tutorials"" are so basic, you may ask why you need them, but you will later.  I have no regrets with my purchase. The game needs improvement in certain areas, but the Devs are aware of that, and are actively taking constructive feedback.   You'll notice a lot of the naysayers don't have a lot of time in game. I am not sure if they even completed the ""tutorial"" aspect of the campaign. That's when the fun begins!  Give it a try!",1

I understand this game obviously just released in Early Access so here's feedback. There needs to be more coherent information sorting and access. The FAQ and Tutorials are great, unless you missed the 3 not-required ones, or have to scroll through the wall of text of the FAQ. Make the FAQ like a book/guide with titles like POWER or INFRASTRUCTURE and make them clickable to go to that location. This game has a great idea with what it can be, but it needs much more time, keep at it devs.",1
138115120,758690,"Having just over an hour into the game, expecting millions of bugs, i am very happy to say i have not encountered one yet. yes i have instantly died a few times, but that was my fault and i like how the game allows you to not wear a helmet outside and die. Also to touch on the tutorial, i have read alot of reviews that the tutorial is way to long.  I do not see it this way, yes the first tutorial is a little over explained, but from there the game is introducing you to characters and a storyline. kind of what Campaign mode is about.  My graphics are set to 2nd from the best and the game runs smooth as can be.  next play i plan to crank em to max and see how it runs. For being in Early Access my first impressions are great !

And the fact the devs released a patch hours later and promised another tomorrow I'm optimistic. The base in campaign can be a bit confusing to navigate I'll say but could be improved with a better map ui or atleast signs or labels on corridors. Have yet to encounter a game breaking bug either. I recommend trying it as long as you bare in mind it's EA.  Edit: 4 hours in, I've started building a base and surviving. I have to say i'm really enjoying this game.

In the first 2 chapters we are lead to believe that stinger flynn is gonna save us, then the second we meet him he just turns against us, with no motivation. Then we have this, stupid, 6 year old ass segment of a car and stinger flynn on the beach, with 3 minute unstoppable dialogue that no one thought was funny. We then have an absurd segment where we put buckets in jail, which I dont even have to explain why that makes no sense. Then we do some stupid annoying segment about the givovanium which is bound to glitch every other attempt and is nothing but a clear way to try and get us over the refund limit. After this we get kidnapped once again by the dude who we thought would be nice. We have ANOTHER clear segment to get us over the refund limit, that of which we work together with someone who actually DID have motives to try and kill us,  And it had no point of existing other than to show what happened to banbaleena and also to get us over the refund limit. Then we had to fight a random person who we had to clue existed prior and no reason to believe we should fight??? Who just so happened to have the two random items we needed which didnt even make sense of us needing in the first place????? AND THEN WE RIDE THE BIRD AND HE DOESNT KILL US??? AND STINGER FLYNN HAPPILY ALLOWS BANBAN TO GO INTO HIS ABSURD LOOKING ""DEMON"" FORM AND CHASE US. Then at the end, (where we can literally see stinger flynns model waiting out of bounds to be used), in a terrible animation sequence we see banban just fly towards jumbo josh, and then stinger flynn tries to save banban and jumbo josh, despite being 1/10th of his size, just KO'S him and the birds kill themselves??????????",0

138116693,1940340,"The good: I played Darkest Dungeon 1 but never got too far because the dungeon diving was a bit too tedious. Darkest Dungeon 2 is a huge improvement. Runs are more streamlined, the stress mechanic is easier to manage, and it has a built-in mechanic making runs easier on respawn that you can CHOOSE to use if you're tired of dying over and over to a particular boss. You're allowed one item use every turn in addition to your normal abilities, so the game strongly rewards preparing specific items for boss fights.  The bad: I'm not a huge fan of the automated character interactions, they just feel kind of soulless and I would've preferred it written into their characters, given the focus on hero memory stuff.  I've only beaten the first boss, but the story to this point is not terribly compelling. So you're more or less playing for the gameplay or revealing memories of the characters on your team.",1

138117802,1159690,"This game loop is boring as hell and for a game that been in EA for 2+ years now it actually sad with how little there is in the game. Literally the gameplay loop is ride your train while gathering every resource you float past than use said resource to make your train bigger and repeat the process, that all you do your train just gets better you don't get new gadgets to play with or weapons or items, and the train doesn't even get faster either just bigger.   Than the few aspect of combat are sometimes you run into a checkpoint so you need to stop the train and kill everyone at it than turn off the power on the gate so you can move on and the other is some optional arena mode that only gives you resources that you can already gather in the void while riding your train.   This game fails as a survival game, the devs have a great idea here but they clearly have no idea wtf their doing, there isn't even an ability to unattach from your train and explore the void your just forever glued to your train it so dam lame.   Somethings this game really needs to shine, more chances to just leave your train were it is and explore islands, facilities, the void in general, a better purpose to ungrade your train other than train get big allow for players to upgrade their weapon through resources, gardens that actually have a purpose, kitchen with interesting food buffs, detectors to find lost treasure deep in the void.",0

My brother and I are at the 3rd station. There are interesting posters to kind of give you a feel of whats gone on in the void. Monsters/Creatures have different characteristics and patterns. Even in the way they swim/fly. Once we got in the same lobby. Our experience was great. Really looking forward to how this turns out. MAJOR plus by the developers posting a roadmap on launch day.

138117122,1159690,"This game is fun, I enjoy it buts its certainly not without its issues. Im aware I cant provide the most accurate assesment with my low playtime but I dont know how much hours I wanna put into the game, ill update the review later. first the positives.   if you like raft, youll probably like this game, the general idea is very similair although I feel rafts executed it a bit better, but theres no point in comparing a game thats early access to one thats finished. The gameplay is fun for me, graphically I enjoy the stylized aspect of it, the enviorment is nice too, I enjoy the gameplay, albiet a bit lackluster, and the general concept is just intriguing to me. others have also expressed the headbobbing and the narrator being annoying, neither of which are an issue for me. In fact I want more of the narrarotor, and the headbobbing might just not effect me since I play a decent amount of vr.  now for the downsides, as others have expressed the upgrade system is painstakinly linear and boring, from what ive played so far the game feels like a crafting and researching simulator with the occasional expediton into the same train stop thats occasionally different. the gathering mechanic is kind of tedious, but who knows there might be more eventually to fix that. the gunplay is alright, the ai isnt too bad, ive seen worse.   how to fix it? add some type of automatic resource gathering, hell just let us automate more things! I dont wanna be stuck carrying things around from smelter to researcher then back to smelter then to workshop and then to lab to just make one thing, its tedious and annoying. A research tree would be incredibely nice, thats one of the games biggest downsides for me, having to research a storage rack before I can do anything else, having a choice would be nice. Some more variety in the stops would be nice, now I dont need every stop to be different, just maybe cycle between a few.   all in all, the game has the potential to be fun, but its still in early access, but so is Ultrakill and that game is fantastic. I dont think it shoudlve been released, and shouldve been worked on until it entered a more finished state.",0
138117001,1159690,"I think its a great game. As soon as we could, we had a full lobby and went 5 hours straight with no bugs or glitches. I already had an epic games store linked to my steam so that wasn't a problem at all, apparently to some it is. If you like trains and the sci-fi movie scene, you'll enjoy this. Be warned: it does require you to gather and collect resources and it can be tedious but relaxing at the same time. Be your own judge and watch game play if you aren't sure.

138117199,758690,The campaign mode is complete nonsense.  after everything you do to get in to the base you run out of water and die or you run out Oxygen and die.  the 4th time i ran out of both.  After playing the Beta version and had so much fun even though there was a lack of in game items it was a blast.   but the full early release version of the game is a major disappointment.  I can not believe you would release the game in this state.  I pray you fix it before it's too late to recoup from this fiasco.  I am still wanting to play this so much.  please fix it and bring it up to spec.  in the campaign add items you can start with if that will help solve some issues.  create a difficulty setting.,0

138116216,758690,"To those who don't understand Early Access....  THERE WILL BE ISSUES ON DAY ONE.....  Why I recommend It: This game I have been waiting for for a long time, ever since I played the demo. The tutorial was little.... annoying, but got through it and found it actually not that long. Ones it got into survival mode, it was interesting. Some things was learn as you go, but there is a great Discord group that will help those who need it. This game is VERY sandbox themed, by you have a lot control of your environment, and how you build it up. I think there will be HUGE improvements in the next while, as seen with already one being released Day One. Developers are listening to the players, and fixing issues that are reported ASAP.  Game play (After Tutorial): you start with a decent amount of materials, and there is a bit of help, but most time you need to learn how to do things (this is where tutorial helps a bit). You will be running around for while to get items, upgrade gear and find specific resources, (mainly Circuit Boards and Tablets). There is many different things you can build, but need to unlock, while needing to keep surviving the Mars environment.  Sound: I turned the music off, some reason no matter how low I have the volume for music, it drowns out other audio. I also don't really like BackGround music, so can't say much there. Other audio seems functional and decent. You do get audio warnings of things happening. IE... Oxygen at 75%, 50%, 25%...   Graphics: not the latest graphics, but for EA game, decent and not glitchy as most EA games I played. There are some textures in wrong spots, or you can walk through some things, but I bet fixed by end of the week (most ones reported).  Controls: I find the pick up then need hit ""E"" to put into inventory a pain at times, since sometimes I want to fast pickup, or when I mine I need to unselect my drill to pick up the goods is annoying, but I have not found many issues with the controls. No issues with movement so far, and able to select things easily. I can get into my Menu easily.  Interface: There has been a few interface issues I heard people have. Infinite Iron, stuck in menus, and such. I do like the different devices you build and how they function, hopefully i see all of it soon. Haven't needed to repair a board yet, which I remember in the demo was fun.   Learning: This is a huge slope. You will need to learn a lot things yourself, but there is a help menu that can assist you. If you're new to Sandbox games, this game might be difficult for you, and might make you not like them. If you played other games like Icarus, Space Engineers, Satisfactory, then you very likely will not have issues with this game.",1

138119145,1375900,oki i love this games style and how the upgrades work.. but id kinda like it. if instead of the robot auto shooting. it let you do the shooting. this causes alot of issues game play wise i lagit am leave in this review cause no one mentions it  this game swarms you alot right. well the robot is horrible at targeting the monsters more of a threat to me. so this gets me killed alot. the upgrades do help alot but it would play alot more smoother if you guys made it run like 20 mins till dawn where the player is in control of the gun. ed least...  and make some of the upgrades run on a % chance of happening when shooting enemies or doing something.  im guna keep the game cause i got it on sale and its a little for for how it is but it would only get better if they did this cause i cant stress enough how horrible the robot is at targeting shit. it made my first play threws kinda hell and not  fun.   if your lookin for a funner expirince id heavily suggest 20 mins till dawn. this game is a 5/10,1
138119916,1742020,"I'll open by saying it's free, so go try it out and form your own opinion.   I would be lying if I said that I have a long history with fighting games, but this one does feel rather clunky to play. There is a lot of balance issues that are explained in detail by people smarter and more dedicated than me, but I'll sum it up by saying that some characters are so unfun to play against that I have to leave the match as soon as it starts, or be stunlocked with no way out besides a well timed burst, which can possibly be just an extra step into their combo.  It has a nice visual identity but I don't think I'll be playing much more of it. Perhaps I'll come back a few months down the line after more polish and balance changes. Seeing as the devs seem to be putting out frequent hotpatches in order to make the game better, I have hope that with time and more importantly playtesting/feedback they'll be able to make this something great. So for now I'll keep it a negative review, until the game changes enough to justify a positive one.",0

Also the game has a worthless 5ish minute delay before you get to actually start your run.

138119705,1940340,"A satisfying roguelike that harkens back to the original Darkest Dungeon while being its own game. The visual and sound design is glorious, and Wayne June's narration is as iconic as ever. Combat is well balanced and enjoyable. The roguelike design means that there is substantially less grind and overall frustration. You will have bad runs, but you won't spend several dozen hours recovering from a party wipe that killed all your top rank heroes. Instead, you'll just... start over and try again.   Most of the negative reviews complain that Darkest Dungeon 2 is too different from its predecessor, which I think is misguided criticism, but should inform your purchasing choice. If you just wanted DD1 but with a graphical upgrade, you won't be happy with DD2. But if you want a strong standalone game in that memorable Darkest Dungeon style, you're gonna have a good time.",1
138119686,1940340,"Loved Darkest Dungeon I, here's my take on the sequel  It is NOT the same game, the formula is different but it still retains the characters, story, and beautiful art style but much improved. The Roguelite elements are noticeable after you get the hang of it and by that point you'll realize how it really is a different game.  The gameplay loop is set around picking your characters, wagoning through the map as best you can (and as far as possible), picking your route to go through the encounters that you want, and trying to make it to the next inn where you'll recuperate losses by healing and shopping for trinkets, and finally repeating it as you venture into another area of your choosing only to inevitably die and get Candles which you use to upgrade and unlock characters and wagon perks.   After your death, you lose everything! Characters aren't as near and dear to your heart as the first one. There is no permadeath and you can recruit them again (or change their name if you want for the sake of continuation). This part I was questioning until I realized that is essentially how the first game is. So instead of supplying you with an endless supply of the same hero with different names / skins, you get a static pool and you're really picking the class of characters you want to bring with you.  You use the Candles after each expedition to upgrade the classes and unlock their backstories (which also unlocks skills). So far that's the main difference between DD 1 and DD 2, but it is still a rewarding loop.  Great game nonetheless! Don't forget to get the Iron Crown Bundle if you previously owned DD one.",1
138119574,1940340,Good,1

138119430,1159690,"Progression in this game is a sluggish grind and very unrewarding. Gathering resources never seems to speed up. Nothing really changes zone to zone, train upgrades feel pretty pointless and don't change game play other than just allowing you to grind for more upgrades. Exploration is slow, very limited, and feels like a chore rather than something exciting to do. Chest rewards for completing puzzles just spit out some more basic resources, how exciting.   The one thing that really got me interested in this game though is the combat and weapon crafting system, however they are a massive disappointment. The gun play is very, very bad making combat extremely frustrating. Accuracy seems to be randomized to the point of having a rifle pointed dead center at a stationary target and taking paced shots leads to you missing half your bullets. Guns will randomly jam, which with the amount of bugs in this game took me a while to realize it was a feature and not my reload glitching. Enemies will shoot you with laser accuracy even hitting you while completely behind some objects.   The weapon crafting system could definitely be reworked, but as of now, your inventory just gets flooded with a bunch of trash components that you can't even tell what they do until you go to the workbench. You can't even see if they are for a long gun or a revolver without being at the workbench. Guns that drop don't show components either and are a pain to compare.   I was having fun for the first 3-4 hours of game play but after a few gates it got to be monotonous and nothing that I unlocked felt like it made an actual difference. If anything the game gets more grindy as you make progress which is kind of the opposite how of these types of games typically work. Not worth $30, there are plenty of similar crafting style games that do it much better.",0

138119467,758690,"I really wanted to like this, a little like Planet Crafter but way less polished.  After 40 minutes of playing the campaign I got caught in an infinite death loop while trying to escape.  Trying again would immediately load with my characters accidental death.    As some other players have mentioned: Pretty buggy when trying to talk to people or interact with items.  Had to press E/LMB multiple times and make sure I was angled ""properly"" to engage the item.  Airlock pressurization delay and sound is way overboard and breaks immersion instead of adding it.  More of a personal taste, but takes an exceedingly long time to actually play.  Perhaps I'm too judgemental after playing games like Planet Crafter and Subnautica...but it's ok to not hold a player's hand on everything.  This felt like unnecessary coddling.    I may revisit it depending on more bug squashing and overall polishing, but in its current state (unplayable after the death loop) and being built on Unity instead of Unreal Engine...I can't justify spending anymore time on this...especially for the price.",0

138119336,758690,"I played this a little while through beta, since I backed it on Kickstarter. At early-access release time, Occupy Mars is a solid installment in the space survival genre, in the same theme as Empyrion, Osiris: New Dawn and Eden Star.   I am having fun in the freeplay mode, figuring out power, base mechanics, and how to survive. There are some unique mechanics in this one, including a very cool electrical/fluid cable system and integrated screens on many machines.   It was a really good choice on behalf of the developers to have both a campaign and a more open survival experience in this one. In my opinion, the freeplay mode is far beyond the campaign.   Freeplay is incredibly immersive, as you get dropped on Mars with no direct tutorials, a tablet with basic knowledge about technology, and you have to figure out how to survive. The soundtrack in freeplay is top-quality for a game like this, and adds to the atmosphere (or lack thereof) quite well.  If the idea of landing on Mars, developing the technology to survive, while collecting resources and finding secrets interests you - pick this up for the freeplay mode, it's worth it.   I love any game with GIANT QUESTION MARKS on the map. Those make me happy, and this game has a massive map with a lot of those.   The campaign goes in more of a traditional direction, with quests, NPCs and navigation markers, and doesn't hit a high bar with its dialogue or character development.   I couldn't really get into the campaign due to this. If you are looking for a developed, single-player RPG experience in space, something like Everspace 2 or Empyrion might be a better pick for you instead.",1

It's def worth to at least try it out..   ** BE WARNED**  I'd say you can just try it and refund it within 2 hours.. but.. I was 5 hours in too deep before I realised it was too late .. xD  Jokes aside its a great game to relax and just unwind and get lost in.",1
138120632,1547670,"An amazing experience that I'm eager to see grow :)! As someone who has been a fan of Cryptids for quite some time, this game hits the right notes.  The first encounter had me hiding behind doors, yet eager to see wat was on the other side.   So do I suggest this game? Yes, absolutely Like many games, it's so much more fun w/friends, or even random fellow Hunters.  Multiplayer runs stable, movement is very crisp.  This game gives me nostalgic vibes to a strong degree, from watching spooky shows as a nugget, to my interest in the unknown as an adult.   Stay vigilant hunters!  -AJ",1

138120983,1159690,"Okay - these reviews are driving me mad.   This game is GREAT. And it has so much potential to be AMAZING. The reviews complaining about connecting to Epic are completely irrelevant. If you don't want to take about 5 minutes to create an account and connect it-- HELL, if you don't wanna spend 5 seconds connecting your already connected epic account to Steam, just stop reading now. It's completely pointless and the fact that connecting an account is enough to stop you from playing a game downright says so much about your willingness to try anything in your life.   Now, onto the actual review.   This game has amazing graphics. Like, I genuinely love them. It's not realistic but stylized in a way that I love. If you've ever played a game called *Close to the Sun*; that's the kind of style I mean, but honestly a bit better. It has an amazing atmosphere, and while the fog can get a little bit annoying regarding vision, worth it, cause god damn does it look good. Currently, I am running a 3070 with 16 GB of ram and running it smoothly on all epic graphic settings.   Onto bugs. Yeah, woopty doo, an early access game is gonna have bugs. It literally says in massive letters what it is. You don't have to be a dick about it. Just say ""Oh yeah, sometimes I get soft locked into the journal, but it's not a massive deal considering."" Either way, I haven't even had that bug. Others have just mentioned it. I actually don't remember experiencing any bugs at all, and I played with a friend, so I really should have.   Gameplay: I love it. The way you progress is sick, I don't get how people don't understand that after 2 hours of playing a game, it's not gonna be instantly easier. Games like this take time, if no one has realized that at this point. So, if you don't want to actually spend time trying to get something, don't get this game, because there's a decent amount. I'm at 1.6 hours and my friend and I have just reached the armor plating and such. I genuinely think people haven't played a game like this once, and I'm not even close to saying I'm better because I'm definitely not. I'm just saying, have patience with games like these, because you'll need it. The number of times my friend and I have been like ""Oh shit, we need metal go back."" Because there was none in front of us was insane. So? Who cares. You're gonna have to grind the game sometimes and do stuff you don't entirely wanna do. It's not Final Fantasy 14 online for god sake, but there's gonna be a little bit of grind. And yeah, you're gonna have to repair your train. So what. Shit happens. So if you also don't wanna spend time repairing it, don't get the game. This game is badass. Fight space sharks, or whatever. Shoot the little squiggly dudes in the air for absolutely no reason, because why not? Make a sick train, because why not? Go around and swim in space, even if it is a little slow. It's fucking fun. Like, I haven't had this much fun in a while.   AND PLEASE: Can I make something CLEAR. It is an early-access game. It is not, in no way, perfect. I mean hell, it won't even be perfect after that. No games are perfect. That's what makes them fun. There's always something to look forward to, whether that be bug fixes or new content. Things are gonna go wrong, even in games. It happens in Minecraft, for the love of god. Oh shit, my house got blown up by a creeper. Time to call it quits, I guess. No, ya'll never did that unless it was a continuous grind and you were tired, lmao. Look past the bugs, look past all the little quirks, (even though I find them absolutely hilarious), and just have fun man. I'm tired of people shitting on games that have amazing potential solely because of stupid stuff. So many games, (Cyberpunk 2077, Witcher 3) have been shit on while me (and the same friend, btw) had an amazing time because we'd laugh at the bugs. Yeah, my car in Cyberpunk spawning in mid-air and falling as I get in it? Fucking hilarious. Sure, some aren't as fun sometimes if they're game-breaking, but don't shit on it. Give you're opinion, without being harsh of course, and go on with your day. I love this game. It's a lot of fun, if you don't agree with what I say then don't get the game and leave me alone. It's a lot of fun. Just give it a chance. (fyi, notice how Cyberpunk had mostly negative reviews and now it has mostly positive. Yeah, things do get fixed ;) )   EDIT: Forgot to add one point. Fighting the ""human"" dudes, or whatever they are. Once. Again. Early access game. People are complaining cause they're boring and they shoot like Stormtroopers. 2 points here. Oh my god?!?!?! They don't look different?!?!? Bro. Early access, helloooo? And the other point. I really don't know if my friend and I just suck, but my friend died from one of them and I was very close to it. So. I don't know. Maybe we just suck. Oh well :) Either way, I like em. They're neat.   Devs, you guys are doing amazing and you have my support and my friends as well. I know I don't have many hours but you guys have created a game that I never expected to see, and I can't wait to see what you guys do in the future. :)",1
138120689,1159690,"A game that has such a great idea behind it but executed by the worst people. Any type of fun sandbox is stripped away from how railroaded (hehe) every single thing is.

138120257,1159690,"It took me roughly an hour to realize that this was not for me. The gameplay loop of this game feels way too stretched out for my taste, specially the materials farming and unlocking tech and blueprints: you spend 20 minutes getting materials to unlock a blueprint, you craft the blueprint, repeat that 3 times, unlock the next tech tier, repeat everything all over again, each loop taking a little longer. Just to be sure, I checked some gameplay videos of people that played longer than me and I could confirm that this doesn't change later on. This game has a few interesting and fun concepts, but I don't like the idea of having to mindlessly farm 10 times the exact same things for 2 hours to be able to see those concepts. I see potential in the game though, so maybe after some balancing and updates it could get interesting. For now I'll ask for a refund and check it again in a couple of months.",0

138120151,2229260,"I have played this game on and off over the years before it was shut down. Now it has a reboot. The graphics are okay, they are from 2011 but they are cute and colorful. The user interface isn't the best, but it is a user interface. Actually, quite a bit about this game is kinda ""meh"" but I would still recommend it to ppl, and here is why:  * The story is hilarious. Yes, the translation isn't perfect but if you actually take the time and read the quests, you will get quite a few laughts out of it * It just re-launched, so you get to actually enjoy all the content instead of grinding to the max and then only seeing the endgame content. This game has so many nice areas to explore, and now they get a new chance to shine * For a f2p game, making ingame money is actually easy. Grindy, sure, but in the week the game has been out I made enough to start buying some of the cheaper cash shop items just by casual play * There are tons of options for mounts, outfits and stuff, and thanks to the auction house those are available to everyone * All dungeons come with an easier solo version for quests and to learn it * Even without the cash shop items, there is tons of stuff to collect * The game is f2p, so there is nothing stopping you from trying it out  [b]Why are all reviews so negative?[/b] Basically the game re-launched with quite a few bugs and exploits on a Friday. The develepment team wasn't available on the weekend to fix things and on Monday, instead of having an instant fix, they disabled the npc allowing those exploits to happen. Shocking, yes. Programming and bugfixing takes time, and unlike before, when the game was basically abandoned after 2017, it now has a team working on it, and there is hope. Hope for new content, hope for improvements and hope for a great community, at least once the community stops complaining about every little thing.   [b]Would I spend money on this, in it current state?[/b] No. Not until it has been out for a while and I have assured myself that it is around to stay for the forseable future. But I don't need to. In all my years of playing this game since 2011 I have spent maybe 200€ total on it, and I still had fun with the game, and I had every cash shop item I wanted anyway.  [b]Final statement:[/b] Yes, the game is in a less than ideal state, but I believe that that will be changed soon. Try it out, if you enjoy it, you will be able to look past that until it is fixed. If you don't enjoy it, then it is most likely not the game for you, regardless of the existance of bugs or not. Not every game is for everyone. Give it a try and decide for yourself, don't let yourself be stopped by the negative reviews of impatient ppl.",1

138121444,758690,"A bit of a rough launch but for an Early Access game, I've seen worst. The tutorial is a bit long for an avid survival fan but it does give you a good introduction to some of the mechanics of the game. While it can be annoying, its fairly short  Controls are a bit funky but not unbearable, a few stutter problems here and there for me but otherwise performance seemed fine.  I'll need to play some more before I can truly justify the price tag at the moment but it has a lot of promise and I've enjoyed the short time so far. I'll update as I play more but definitely something to wish list at the very least.  A host of negative reviews had me concerned at first but those far I haven't experienced anything so far.  The Good: Initial story seems promising. Large world with things to see and do within it, it doesn't entirely feel like an empty expanse. (It is Mars so some emptiness is to be expected) The survival isn't hard but doesn't feel easy either. Once you have a good system in place its nice but its easy to also have that fail or come crashing down Different environmental effects and robots/vehicles add an interesting element of play.  The Bads: Somewhat rough tutorial A few bugs with controls, textures, etc. Nothing I've found that broke things for me. Could use some polishing when using terminals and such. They don't feel bad but they just feel off.  Overall how you might feel about the game will vary from person to person. I've paid more for games and had a worst experience, but I've also paid less and had a great experience. I'm excited to continue playing it and with a vocal development staff, I have high hopes for where this will go.",1
138120822,758690,"I will recommend this game only because it is early access and they have the basic framework for a hardcore survival. the pacing needs some work and the collision too. I have lost a few circuit boards to straight up them phasing thorough the ground, plus they are a real pain to even find. grinding tech points is overly tedious, and you cant grind down even some of the most basic structures you can build. some good feedback would be if you can build it you can either repair it or scrap it. I would love to restore an old outpost to working function. otherwise I put about 6 hours in the game before leaving this review since I just kinda got stuck, or the grind feels so hard it makes me need to take a break and leave it for another day. and I spent about 4 of those hours just hard grinding, it feels more like a demo in the way the progression is. this game is kinda buggy but for the most part runs well especially for a small developer game and after all it is a early release and there going to keep working on things. good luck and thrive on!",1
138120341,758690,"I loved the prologue, I think the campaign is ok. I lot of running around and frankly confusing. Great tutorials and never had time to try free play but remember it from prologue.  It needs a few fixes but overall is a great start to what I`m feeling will be a great game. So many of these game come out missing a tutorial and the confusion dis interests me from playing again.(space engineers) But this game did a great job explaining everything. Keep up the great work devs, looking forward to a great many hours working the rover.",1
138120260,758690,"Ok.. I tried. I put in a fair ~9 hours. Constructive feedback time..  I'll try to keep it as concise as possible. What feels bad:   In a game with so many levers, you get action locked into using every single lever. If you are a couple of steps too far away and try to use a lever, you will get action locked into taking baby steps until you can reach said lever.. and then slowly pull it down all the way and stare at it until it goes back up. That feels terrible.. The best levers in the game are when you are running to the escape pod and the timer has stopped.. the lever to the hatches leading to the busted elevator. You click them and they move.. simple. This goes for anything that locks you into an action like that. Opening overhead compartments included.    Accessing your Pipboy seems pretty slow too. Maybe this is just a gripe from me, but it feels like Fallout where it takes too long. It could just be that I'm already frustrated from the time to use levers, so that might just be a me thing.     The choice to not let me use my map on the ATV is a brutal one. Maybe it's because it's tied to your Pipboy.. err.. Marsboy? How about just having the map pop up on your face shield while you're driving?    The tutorial. The tutorial is dope in the lore category. I don't mind that. But it feels long winded and like you're running through a maze doing irrelevant stuff. In 9 hours, I haven't needed to replace a fuse or any of that. Granted - some of my time was spend reloading or walking away for a little bit out of frustration. Also, when you first land in your recovery vessel, you would think that you need to get material points by scrapping. So, people generally grab the grinder and go to the nearest base to grind away only to find out that they need an upgraded grinder. Hopefully they find out that they need to use the grinder on the smaller boxes and such inside.  BUGS:   The workbench. It basically is a bug. Your tools disappearing. Finishing a repair doesn't repair always. Sometimes you can dupe a small circuit board, etc... It's such a cool idea, but I feel like it went from idea to Prod and skipped QA.   The advanced tablets. Those things you read to get the advanced schematics... yea.. It really sucks to ride out to a POI on your ATV (stopping every few minutes to hop off and check the map) and see that the advanced tablet has fallen through the floor of a structure that you need a higher level grinder to make it through.  This is my first review - so sorry for the crappy formatting. That's it. Cheers.",0
138122212,2311190,"This is an interesting experience. Ive genuinely invested myself into the garten of banban series. It started off as a sick curiosity, but now i've grown quite attached. Leaving a bad review for this is like leaving a bad review for my own child. From what ive seen, the developers seem like okay people, so here's what i like and dislike about the game:  First off, I really like the really surreal aspects of this game. The car scene was great, and i didnt mind the parts with stinger flynn. I think in the future games if you leaned into the more surreal and bizarre aspects (not just in cutscenes, but in the the aesthetics and gameplay) it would be a lot more fun and unique. A lot of people criticize the characters and the voices but there's a certain charm to it.   The main thing I dont enjoy about this game is the unforgiving puzzles. Not every puzzle is bad, and im glad the developers are trying new things, but it felt like some of the puzzles were stretched out so that I wouldn't be able to refund the game. I wouldn't want to refund the game if the puzzles were just fun in the first place. Some things aren't very clear while some parts are just frustrating (For example, the stinger-flynn shooting minigames and the bossfight, while surprising and unique, was extremely frustrating and repetitive)  What also makes these puzzles so frustrating is that when you die, you often have to redo very large segments of the game. For example, dying to Blue Opila at the end led me to having to re-get the hat for the Metal Banban thing, leading to minutes of just backtracking over and over again. there were a lot of points like this, and It felt unnecessary. Maybe a save system would help.  I genuinely see improvement in some aspects, and i do think the developers have a lot of potential, but this one had a lot of moments bogging it down and i felt it wasn't worth the five dollars i paid for. I am still planning to see where this series heads.",0

138123263,2346890,"Game is good. Entertaining platformer with a quite creative gimmick. The world feels well populated and exploration is rewarded but you can also casually walk around and get enough coins to progress. Jokes are good, I especially like how the banana village houses have banana-shaped doors. artstyle is simple but pretty and well executed.  However, the game has some quite frankly newbie mistakes that could very well not exist. A map would be welcome (even if as a collectable you have to buy). Wall jumps just don't feel nice. It's not impossible to get used to, but it might fail you more than once. Losing keys also don't really add difficulty, it's just unpleasant to repeat a task you've already succeeded because you missed a jump. That last one however, is fine, just a nitpick.  Overall, it's worth the price, but don't expect a masterpiece, just a fun little experience. If you are bored, this game will keep you entertained for some hours.

138123042,1742020,"This game is friggin amazing, and that the devs did a fantastic job making it.  However, I do have some minor gripes about the game.  Firstly, I was rather disappointed with the lack of a continue option in Arcade Mode.  From where I'm sitting, that's a staple feature of nearly every fighting game, and it's disappointing that it isn't in this one.  Secondly, not having difficulty options can make the game's single-player content rather hard to get into for newcomers (and no, the faux-difficulty select in Virtual Frontier doesn't count).  Compound this with the fact that you can only get some of the colors through this single-player content, and you have a bit of a barrier for not only casual players, but also completionist scrubs like myself.  And unless another way to acquire these unlockable colors is added in the future (i.e. just buying them outright with the Pekos gained in Virtual Frontier), I can really only recommend the single-player content to those who have a great amount of experience playing fighting games in a competitive setting.  Aside from that, though, I would still recommend anyone, VTuber fan or not, get this game.  It's a heckuva good time with friends, and certainly has the competitive depth that can rival its peers in the genre.",1

Combat is challenging and rewards team comps that are though out in advance while still beating you down with the atmosphere and hazards along the way. Playing the game to unlock characters, subclasses, and other upgrades is a great way to make even crushing failures feel useful in the end which is in my opinion a huge improvement considering a party wipe in the first game meant hours of your time died with them.

138122338,1730250,"For those of you wondering how this differs from Dorfromantik, in Dorfromantik you have to care about tile edges, in this you don't. A forest tile is always a forest tile on all six sides. If you're a brainlet like me, you'll find this game a lot easier to cope with.",1
138122968,1547670,"The game runs like a slidehsow on my Steam Deck and crashed my entire system. Most of the UI elements don't work, menus in game don't work. The default controller sensitivity is insanely high, but don't expect to be able to adjust that as the slider doesn't work with a controller. Once had the game crash trying to use the drop-down menus in the multi-player host screen.  This game is like Phasmaphobia, Resident Evil, and Monster hunter got into a horrible car accident and so the doctors just sort of sewed all the remaining pieces back together. They couldn't find enough to make a whole person so the metaphorical doctors filled in the rest with Unity store default assets.  This game is like a solid 3/10, but I imagine it could be a fun late night with the pals game if it had more time to cook. Keep the $9 you could spend on this game, spend it on Taco Bell you'll get more enjoyment out of it and it'll be a higher quality product.",0

Bought this with fairly low expectations, based on some of the reviews, but have had a very enjoyable coop experience, exploring the void and building up a train with a friend. The game is full of charm and it's clear the developers have put a lot of love into this game, and continue to do so. Many of the issues which had brought about negative reviews have already been fixed.  Looking forward to enjoying this train ride as it progresses.",1

138123496,1159690,"It's like a poor man's Raft, except it's more expensive. A friend bought this for both of us because he really wanted us to play and I feel bad for him doing it.  It's not a good builder, as you are limited by the space and number of carts. It's not a good shooter, but tries to throw enemies at you every stop. It doesn't have a fun gameplay loop, either, as it's just reach a checkpoint or station, kill enemies and upgrade, and go back to traversing space to gather the same stuff to do it again. Even the [spoiler] arena and small island puzzles [/spoiler] don't do much to shake this up.  After watching Markiplier play this a year ago, I'm disappointed in how little has changed. It may be Early Access, but between the jank and bugs, it has a long way to go before I would recommend it, especially for the price.",0
138123274,1159690,"Just trying to combat the negative reviews and stuff i've seen... i've even seen others with 2x my playtime saying things that counteract this that are just factually wrong so ill cover the things people have said that aren't opinion based.   ----DO BE AWARE SPOILERS BELOW----  1. Yes you do get to leave the train and explore at some points to kill enemies at outposts and stations and even go explore the void and see the islands. 2, You do get to upgrade your train to go faster through various engines 3. You do get gun upgrades and different gun types 4. You do get grappling hook upgrades eventually 5. There are bonuses you can get to make you produce more resources when you do as well as the fact yes you do collect them all by hand HOWEVER there are resources given after every gate as well as at each checkpoint and later on you can find cashes out in the void that also reward STACKS OF 10+ of multiple resources(from what i've seen so far) BUT things aren't really expensive and the resoruce numbers you need for something is quite low overall (some of the things i craft at this point that id say are expensive require 10 scrap metal total and to gather that yourself 1 at a time isn't that bad)  There are plenty of other complaints that i've seen that are just false as well that i can't recall. A LOT of reviews also complained about view bobbing and inventories disappearing... these were both fixed within 24hrs through 2 hotfixes as well as good communication from the devs on what to expect to be fixed coming up.  I think this game is amazing and like any other survival game you need to do a lot by hand at first. (from what i've heard there might be automation in the game just i've not gotten to it.) It's a bit of a grind as they all are but i'm up for it as i'm sure many of you are as well. I will easily put many more hours into it as well as my friends who hop on to play on the few hours they have loving it as well even though there is much of the game left unseen. Id like to see more action in it sure but that being said. I'M AT GATE 11... some of the gameplay in trailers shows gate 100+... there are many enemy types i see pics of and enemy trains that can show up and so many things that i've not yet seen even at 12hrs. DON'T let these negitive reviews discourage you from buying the game. It's a survival game. it gives you plenty of time to grind up even if you're speeding through because otherwise there's no going back so if the game doesn't progress slow and you ran through it all and skipped things you'd end up stuck. just keep that in mind when things are slow and you'll love the game. there are many RPG elements to the game as well that i wasn't expecting like gun attachments that add 300% projectiles or even poison damage as i just found out minutes before writing this. I hope you all come to love the game as much as i do.",1
138123258,1159690,"I'm not sure why everyone is ragging on this game so much. So far the only issue that I see being a problem is losing your progress in multiplayer, which, don't get me wrong, is a big deal, but that seems to be being worked on and will be fixed in the future. Multiple people are saying ""Don't bother"" or ""it's only worth $5"" I disagree with these completely. Honestly, you should absolutely at least give it a try. Return it if you don't like it, but you'll definitely know within the first 2 hours if you like the style or not. There is so much to explore and I haven't even scratched the surface.  I hope this helps someone. The game is pretty BA and worth the money in my opinion, much more stable and polished than many of the newer games being released today.",1

138123136,2080960,"EDIT: After the day 1 patch, the game runs pretty smoothly.  Phijkchu Quest is a worthy successor to classic titles released by this studio such as Lennod Jump Game (which I've yet to 100%). I am having a blast playing it. There, I said it, nailed my colours to the wall.  In the Phijkchu Quest, you managed a large roster of expendable units who are going on a quest to save a bunch of cleverly named characters with lots of plot. This is a similar story to LJG, but it is a much longer game of attrition, humor, and resources.  In Phijkchu Quest, you manage a tight team of four heroes and develop a progressive rewards system. Your team has to run a gauntlet of biomes, clear enemies and hit checkpoints. This title is a series of short games of tactics, resources, and the occult.  Put simply, it is not as stressful or intense as LJG - and that actually may be a good thing. I enjoy my failed runs and am left eager to play more. The short nature of the Quest means each run wraps things up in 2-3 hours and you slowly unlock more funnys naturally as you play. I beat my first run very quickly and was worried about the length of the game going forwards... happy to report every subsequent run has taken me longer as I discover more and more hidden secrets of this game.  Combat is pretty good, I like the models and attack animations. Music is perhaps the most powerful part of PQ and new songs are included with enough frequency that I'm always hearing something new. I really miss some of his emotive loading screen quotes from LJG. e.g. ""Did you know Lennod likes the Queen?""  There is currently less overall replayability than LJG, I hope PhijkchuGames adds more. Each character has multiple 'paths' to explore while they are on their quest, which you unlock as you explore the lands and converse with different characters, each character (hero?) now has unique backstories to unlock and explore. You have to actively seek out these 'memories' which the hero will relate to his comrades, boosting their party bond. This is a fantastic gameplay addition, slowly drip-feeding us interactive story elements with skill unlocks and bonuses.  I have not even mentioned the achievements yet, the element I was initially most displeased with. After you get over the disturbingly mobile-game feel of the challenges, I began to appreciate the extra strategy layer this was adding. Failure to plan your playthrough around these achievements will result in sadness.  I will not mention what little I know of the plot, except that I am enjoying it. LJG made you play as 'Lennod', but never explored that backstory, leaving it to player assumptions. PQ directly identifies you as a individual and slowly shares your connection to your acnestors with snippets of monologue at every moment while you play the game.  Summary: Whilst playing very different, it still captures the Lennod Jump Game spirit. New players should find this title more accessible then LJG and returning veterans should find enough of the old systems of combat, trinkets and occultism to keep them happy. PhijkchuGames have done it again.",1

(Sometimes it wouldn't register that I was connecting to two separate landmasses) But overall I am enjoying it and would love to see other gods and how they effect playstyle. If I were to critique it as harshly as possible, I'd say that after completing the 3 goals, if your town survives, it gets a little bland as there aren't any more post-game goals. I'd love to see a infinite mode in the final version. Overall though, easy 9.5 out of 10 and I wish the dev(s) nothing but love for this project!",1

However it is very much a rogueLITE in the sense that progression and unlocking the whole game is gated behind many runs. Not an issue if you enjoy the gameplay loop, beware if that's not your thing!",1

Its a shame because you can see the devs tried something new, it just didnt land.  I'll probably play a bit more, maybe enough to fully unlock a single comp that i enjoy.

I waited out the game only being available on Epic. I think I'm glad I did. They have changed and tweaked a lot and it feels a bit more roguelike than the first, but so far I think they are good changes and I've enjoyed them. It's a bit difficult to get used to on your first run - the main issue for me was not knowing what each icon meant (because there are a lot of new ones and in most cases in this game you're forced to look at a glossary and find the one you're trying to understand).  Still has the Darkest Dungeon feel.   [b] [i] Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer. [/i] [/b]",1

If you're a fan of DD1 for the gameplay, this game probably isn't for you. For people who believe aesthetic carries this games weight, I think you're wrong. This game locks power behind death, yes, you can win your first run, it's not impossible, but it is improbable. This game being a roguelite I feel took a LOT out of the strategy and turned into well.

138123800,1730250,"(Relatively) simple yet addictive, yet just short of something truly great. You're tasked with building a town by placing one tile at a time, but the order you're able to place the tiles is random. (You can see the order they spawn in, but only up the next 8 ones.) Placing a tile of similar type next to one upgrades it, and nets an increased amount of points, which are then used to unlock buildings that have various synergies with the tiles and each other. Placing the building in the right order and in the right places keeps you from running out of turns. This is the base loop of the game, and seeing the tiles interact with each other and synergize with the buildings is fairly satisfying it itself...  However, because the tile order is random and the buildings also need a certain formation of tiles in order to be built, you're always in danger of running out of turns and not having the one tile you need. Also, because you're kinda limited in what tiles you have at any given time and where you need to place them for the best point gain, I would have to guess there isn't much variation in what is a 'valid' build as far as beating the game goes. (granted, I've only beaten the game once in full at the time writing.)   and yea, there is a creative mode, but I don't think that's exactly the same... Still despite how much I'm complaining here, I did enjoy it, I just wish there were different biomes with their own buildings and tile mechanics as DLC or future updates. As it is, I dunno I'll get much more out of this after this point.",1

Will update with multiplayer review once my friends get in on it.  Only have a few issues so far- sometimes will randomly start falling while swimming in void, save and reload fixes. Could use more info on items. Would love some more intuitive UI and crafting controls (craft max, more keyboard commands for radials). Kinda disappointing starting with no decoration items to craft. I felt like I was struggling with my inventory management solo, would benefit from craft from chest/sorting. Like others have mentioned, it feels very linear in terms of research/crafting.  Big request- pin construction/item/crafting recipes. Helps for my bad memory.  Overall, it's a very solid EA release! Excited to see where this one goes.",1
138124402,1159690,"I've only played 6 hours but I gotta say, it's worth the money. Single player is def a slower play, if you're trying to get all the resources, but that's perfectly fine. If you want a faster play, group up with a friend or so to make getting resources faster.   The acting with the narrator is just *chef's kiss*. They  do a fantastic job. Some of the reactions from your char are just hilarious, and worth the chuckle you get watching them.   I enjoy the concept behind it - being stuck on a train. I mean, that's the gig. It's different than other survival/crafting games.  The environments are absolutely beautiful, and the scale of the things beyond your train make the mystery even more intense. Where am I? What am I doing here? What happened.   The dev's are incredibly responsive. Some of the comments left had a few personal criticisms and within a day, the fixes were added. It's obvious they care about the game and the community.   I HIGHLY.. highly recommend getting the game now, and support them as they develop it further.",1

138124052,1159690,"The game's pacing is painfully slow. It drip-feeds game mechanics at such a languid pace that even after four hours of gameplay, my friends and I felt like we had only experienced a marginal change from the initial setup. The supposed improvement of upgrading your train seems to detrimentally affect the gameplay, offering negligible benefits.  Every depot encountered during our playthrough was identical, leading to a monotonous visual experience. Surely, the introduction of variation in level layout, lighting, colors, or enemies wouldn't be too much to ask for.  Moreover, the enemies are nearly all identical. The most variation we encountered was a slightly tougher enemy that simply required more damage to defeat. No bosses, no special enemies. Initially, battling these bots was enjoyable, but the novelty quickly wore off. After about an hour, the thought of having to fight these space pirates became tiresome.  I had high expectations for this game, having eagerly anticipated its release after viewing the trailers. My friends and I bought it and dove in without any prior research, hoping to fully immerse ourselves. Unfortunately, the game ended up being a letdown.  In reality, what feels like a mere 3-4 hours of solid gameplay has been artificially extended to an agonizing 30-hour slog. The lack of varied content is a glaring issue that, if addressed, could unlock this game's potential. The game needs to provide a substantial reason to engage in research beyond the current redundant model of ""research to research the next thing"". In retrospect, the game could be completed with a level 1 train without any looting, if not for the forced research quests. This clearly illustrates the flawed progression model of the game.  I get it, it's in ""Early access"" but this game came out in 2021 on Epic games. Where has the funding for the past two years gone? I don't see any improvement since 2021 after looking at reviews from 2 years ago.   Also why is everyone hating on the narrator, he is actually not that bad.  Lastly, HOW HAS NOBODY COMPLAINED ABOUT HOW CHOPPY MULTIPLAYER IS. My buddies and I all run gig connections or better, live about 20 miles or less from each other and yet the game still manages to have horribly choppy experiences for everyone but the host.",0

I look forward to the official release and the many upgrades and expansions it will bring forth.  -Cargran",1

138123827,1230170,"I've largely enjoyed most of the various mechanic simulator games from PlayWay despite their often glaring rough edges and was excited to see them put out a gunsmithing themed game.  First things first, I have no idea why this prologue has its own store page. This should have been a demo on the main store page. Maybe they wanted to keep the feedback separate? Anyways, this game is a demo and the description on this particular page is misleading. There's no creativity or excelling at gunsmithing here, this is a short, guided, hand-holding tutorial that doesn't really give you any freedom at all to play around like the other mechanic games usually do.  With that out of the way there's a lot of neat new game mechanics here compared to the other mechanic simulator games. It looks like we'll be able to make all our own gun parts from scratch which is pretty awesome. The different gun configurations are neat as well, but the way it's implemented is really clunky and kind of limiting with no ability to freely change out stocks/barrels/rails/etc, you have to pick a developer-made config for the gun and hope it has the combination of things you're looking for.  Same thing for changing out parts on guns, the game requires you to FULLY disassemble each gun before you can swap out any parts even if it makes no sense like changing a stock.  The shooting range is a neat idea, but also needs some work. First off, your character is a complete idiot with gun safety and you can just shoot random stuff everywhere with no repercussions. For a game supposedly representing realistic gunsmithing, it should also represent realistic firearm safety. There's way too many games already where you just run around being crazy with guns, let's have one that depicts real gun culture and have our character hold guns in safe positions when not at the firing line.  That said, we should have a plinking range where we can set up random stuff (bottles, cans, pumpkins, watermelons, ballistic gel, dummies, etc) and shoot them for fun to see what happens with different types of ammo.  Otherwise this looks like a really solid foundation for a game and I'm tentatively excited for the full release later this year.",1
138123818,1230170,fun little game to see how every part works in the gun and have fun customizing the gun I am pretty excited to see what else they gonna include in the full game,1

138125242,758690,"This game got potential, i played about 12 hours without a single game-breaking bug, lucky i guess as i head others complaining a lot.. Its very slow pace if you dont know what you doing, exploring is a must to find new tech/ circuit boards and progress and build more stuff. Even after 12 hours i dont have a rover still chilling with atv lol So ya slow paced. Lots of hand mining better be prepared:) There is no story once you get past the starting tutorial campaign thing, you find some datapads for info but thats about it that i found out so far. Hopefully it will be more interesting to explore in the future and find cool things around the map. Ill update as i play further.",1

There is a few audio bugs when mining resources but the devs have just rolled out a patch which has fixed this some what, Great changes from the prologue and how the tech trees are laid out. Further more the new addition to the abandon data tablets are great as they keep you exploring, is the game perfect no but other than the audio issues I've had nothing has really put me off wanting to play.  Would I recommend this game? Yes only if you don't want everything handed to you on a plate you will have to work for unlocking better techs.

138124939,758690,I got launched butt first into a trash can lmao,1
138124043,758690,"Quick answer: yes buy this. It's on an introductory offer, absolutely worth it at this price, it's a fun survival game with a big tech tree and lots of stuff to build! The negative reviews feel a little too quick, give this a good shot and you might enjoy it!  Longer answer: It's got some endearingly janky dialogue, the controls are a little floaty and at times feel a bit laggy (not due to performance, just animations), it needs some polish around gameplay (a helmet toggle button is a must!), and the graphics are a bit washed-out and muddy in 4k, but it performs well. It is kinda fiddly but that's the point, construction requires a lot of minutiae to do. What you're getting right away is a solid game that works and has things to do, if you like survival and crafting games, this is a good one and it'll definitely get better starting out where it is.  I think it's worth a look! They've honestly put out one of the most complete-feeling early-access games I've seen in awhile. Nice work, peeps!",1
138123867,758690,"In it's current state, based on the first hour of game play, I can't recommend right now.  Mainly, everything feels kind of cumbersome from basic mechanics to UI. Things like waiting for door after door after door to open, for your view to switch to third person and an animation to play when you put your helmet on or off, for it to be difficult to tell if an airlock door is really an airlock or if it's just moving into another pressurized room, to not being able to go outside at night so you need to go back and traverse all those doors again to sleep and walk back...it just slowly grates on you.  It feels like the developers focused so much on making a simulator of a Mars base that they didn't really focus on what would make a fun game.  The entire first part of the game (I made it an hour), is basically fetch quests and running back and forth between different areas to grab a thing and hear more dialogue.  These minutes are precious to hooking a player and need to highlight the core mechanics and best parts of the game. If this is all there is to offer right now then I don't think I will be back. It's obvious a lot of work went into this, but for a game of this scale it really needs much more time and play testing and feedback.  I'll come back in a few months and see whats up though and update review accordingly!",0

138126706,1940340,"A different game to the first one with exploration elements similar to StS and tight combat. For me i prefer DD2 to the first with over 80 hours on the EGS, the game is punishing but rewarding and the metaprogression system always making each run feel worthwhile.",1
138126516,1940340,DON'T PLAY THIS GAME BEFORE DARKEST DUNGEONS 1  darkest dungeons two is like a spinoff of the first game with many changes to the overall formula for better and for worse. Darkest dungeons one was a brutal strategy game where sometimes rng would absolutely fuck you but the game never felt too punishing to the point where I felt like I couldn't progress. Dd1 was bipolar with its high highs and it low lows. I remeber fighting the finale boss in dd1 as 2 of my heros died how I felt that it was over my A team of heros I had built throught the game were dying with only a highway man and a vestle my fate was sealed. Until when my highway mans stressed was maxxed he showed he was a ture hero and became courageous and was able to do the last bit of damage to beat the game.  Dd2 does not have that micromanage character building aspect of the first game and instead favors a more streamlined rpg rougelike while keeping the gameplay style of dd1. DD2 will have those moments where you feel hopeless and defeated but push through but with lot less connection to the actual heros you are using. One thing I loved that dd2 added was hero backstories. Hero backstorys act as puzzles that need to be solved and will unlock new skills for your hero that were in dd1 with some new contenders. It building upon the lore of the characters that I love.  Overall dd2 is like a darkest dungeons spin off. I only recommend dd2 if you played and enjoyed the first game and want a fun rougelike that builds upon character lore and story but cuts out the real meat of dd1 leaving an Okish rpg with amazing graphics.,1
138126451,1940340,"1. Thrilling journey all the way with huge amount of re-playable content.   2. Game's visuals and sound tracks are simply breathtaking, immerse you into a world that is both beautiful and terrifying.   3. Well balance characters and skills. The attention to detail is remarkable, down to each character, enemy, and environment.",1
138126372,1940340,"The only reasons listed on the negative reviews is just ""The game isen't exactly the same as the first :(((("" despite the developers saying several times across development that the entire point of the game is to not just be the first game again. If rogue-likes arn't for you, then just dont play it and complain when its not exactly what you wanted.  The combat systems are improved, the 3D environments, music and narration are great, and the affinity mechanics are meaningful. I can understand the negative reception during the start if early access, as at that time the affinity/driving/combat was underdeveloped and had major oversights, but since that literally all of those systems have been completely reworked from the ground up based on user feedback. Another complain is that there is no steam deck support or whatever, but again they have said they are adding that as soon as possible, as they have said dozens of times on their social media, same with modding support, points shop ect.  Very few of the negative reviews know how to check something online before posting.",1
138126218,1940340,This game is nothing like DD1. It takes a radically different approach. Yet i still like it. I completely understand if DD1 players don't like the sequel.,1
138126152,1940340,Great game. Still going trough progression but love the game.,1
138126124,1940340,"This is another review basically telling you how the first game is better, bla bla bla. I don't think this game is worth the $40 tag, as of now it offers a very boring gameplay loop with alot of frustating mechanics (looking at you cart hp/wheel) the relationship mechanic fucking sucks too by the way, it sounds cool and it feels cool, but it's very unbalanced and frustrating to deal with in the actual game, overall this game was already a miss for me back when I tried it's first version back on Epic but I told myself i'd give it a second chance, still a miss. While I am still having a bit of fun (since it's the same combat feeling I love about DD1) I'd totally recommend grabbing the first game instead for a more interesting gameplay """"loop"""" and progression. If Steam reviews had a middle ground between Yes and No, I'd probably give it that, it's not a TERRIBLE game, just doesn't lived up to the hype from the first one, changed so many things many of us loved from the first and turned it into a more soulless game.  TL;DR: Game's majorly different from the first one (in a bad way), boring roguelike loop, feels like a soulless sequel. Although if you like faster gameplay and hate the DD1 grind, this game might be for you, not for me though",0

138126606,1159690,The opening scene took me by a surprise! What a way to capture someone’s attention.,1
138126546,1159690,"This game is incredibly fun with friends.  Of course this isn't all i'm going to say but let me just put it out here. The game itself is enjoyable, I have two saves currently running, a multiplayer save where i have enjoyed the gameplay loop and resource gathering with friends to the point that we have garnered a system on who does what (I got to shoot things HEHEEHEHEHE)  A lot about the game is really slow, but that is the main point of ""These"" types of survival games. The gameplay is supposed to be slow but rewarding... Although the rewarding part isn't quite there yet.  I've seen people complain about it in other reviews, and i'll complain about it too. The research table's current system is terrible. It's just so... unrewarding. I could spend a whole hour collecting resources just to spend the next few hours going through the research table seeing things that are just not worth researching but im FORCED to research it. Example, Farm plots. They serve absolutely no practical use in the early game yet it's so early in the research table.  UNLIKE other people's reviews. I do have an idea to bring to the table instead of just complaining about the game.  Instead of the current ""You have to unlock this and this to progress the research table"" Maybe introduce a system like Rust has for their research table. Have it be a whole viewable tree of things to research so we can research things in our own time. It would make it so we won't be forced to have useless things in our research table early game and allow us to focus on getting the ones we want more.  Apart from that suggestion, i really do like the aesthetics, i do get framerate drops but i know for a fact that it's just my own computer. The gunplay is pretty messy, but i don't mind it. The AI is a bit nutty with it's shooting but it isn't like how i see other people complaining, that being so accurate that there is no chance to not get shot by them.  All i have to say to them is, Get good.  The building mechanic where you can place things you want WHEREVER on the train is something i LOVE. I can focus on putting things neatly into corners and having things look nice and appealing every time i return to the train.   The one thing that i LOVE about this game though, which is in my opinion, the best feature...  YOU CAN SHOOT THE GOD DAMN BRAKE AND OTHER SWITCH TO FLIP THEM AND ITS THE MOST USEFUL THING EVER!",1
138126043,1159690,"A solid game 8.5 game as is for the Survival genre, with a fresh concept for a very repetitive field.

138125985,1159690,"A friend of mine had gifted me a copy of this game.  At the time, I wasn't aware of the reviews of the game, and when I saw the reviews quickly become mixed I became concerned.  But the more I read into them, the more I noticed how more and more people were picking this game apart, and rather unfairly.  However, I noticed some of the positive reviews claim [b]the devs are listening to the comments and doing their best to address feedback in a timely manner.[/b]  When the hotfix landed, it affirmed the good things I had been hearing while making some of the negative comments seem more and more biased.  So, I decided to load the game up to see for myself what rumors were true or false.  My thoughts so far:  -[b]Character creation is more limited than a AAA title but still has a decent selection of facial and body options.[/b]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Considering this is what I believe is an indie game, this is actually quite good.  It doesn't need Skyrim/Monster Hunter levels of customization.  Hell, you get more choices than Raft, and that's considered a GREAT game.  -The game does indeed open up a webpage prompting you to link your steam account when starting up the game.  [b]It is not explained what this is for,[/b] and I strongly recommend against doing this.  However, there's no harm in doing so if your account is already linked.    -I DO know Voidtrain had an exclusivity deal with Epic Games Store because otherwise they would have released in alpha almost two years ago on Steam.  However, considering the game still is not finished, I am actually not that disappointed now.

138125861,1159690,"I think a lot of the bad reviews are a bit harsh. Of course an Epic game is going to have  you log into Epic launcher... not a big deal. Yes at the beginning it's a bit ""grindy"" but that is survival games. It's the reason to play a survival game in general. I've been looking forward  to this title and I am very much enjoying it so far. I think most of the bad reviews talking about ""gates being too close together so you can't get anything done"" or ""you have to grind for too long to get anywhere"" just didn't understand what they were signing up for. This is a well rounded survival crafting game. By gate 5 you can easily have a steam engine if you do it right. (probably earlier but that's when I got mine) Play with friends and enjoy the exploration for what it is. You wanna rush play a different game. I'm excited for ALL of the possibilities that are set ahead and I think this game has some massive potential to be long lasting and amazing.  Long story short definitely worth the $30 they are asking even if it is early access considering the length possible if played correctly and the expansion capability. 10/10 would recommend.",1

If you do try it, do yourself a favor and go straight to sandbox and skip the campaign/tutorials, they're worse than worthless.  Pros:    * the power management is interesting and seems to be a challenging puzzle.  you string together solar panels and transformers with snaking cables to power your base.  power is limited enough to encourage you to go exploring   * cool tech tree/experience system where you unlock more points in the area you spend more time in.   * survival aspects, i.e. food/water/oxygen/health are in-line with most other space survival games.   * sandbox mode is engaging enough and it's fun to discover the mechanics   * repairing the circuit boards is an interesting and creative minigame, though the interface to it is too sensitive.  Cons:   * bugs, oh god the bugs.  crashes are frequent enough to be deterring, items disappear, you can get locked behind menus after exiting, and for some reason every time i reload the game i'm stuck with only Y-axis movement of the mouse.   * movement feels clunky and slow. i think the ATV is slower than running.   * interacting with objects takes away camera control/movement until the animation is done (super annoying).  taking your helmet off/on sticks you with an 8 second unskippable cutscene where you let down your horribly rendered hair.  every. time.  who thought that was a good idea?   * no build queue or any way of tracking which items you're missing for a construction   * campaign and tutorials are best left skipped.  seriously don't even open up the campaign mode.   * music gets repetitive really fast, and isn't very good to begin with. just turn it off and play your own in the background.   * boulders jiggle and dance as you mine them   * mining is a boring time-sink where you sit there and hold left click for about half your game time.  it could be 10x faster and still feel too slow.  honestly i almost uninstalled the game after the first mining run.   * somehow I got shipped off to mars with only two water bottles and no circuit boards, despite literally all of my critical infrastructure needing circuit boards.   * you need water stockpiled to sleep?   * no way to refill water/oxygen/suit power inside the workshop in the time i played.  running out into the cold, taking damage, just to get enough water to sleep til morning is ridiculous.   * temperatures in general seem very buggy and inconsistent.  i had a workshop full of plants freeze to death despite it being powered the whole time.

Your goal is to establish a fully functioning base on the planet, complete with all the necessary resources and infrastructure to sustain human life. Along the way, you'll encounter a range of challenges and obstacles, from harsh weather conditions to equipment malfunctions and other unexpected encounters.  One of the things I loved most about Occupy Mars is its attention to detail. The game does an excellent job of recreating the harsh and unforgiving environment of Mars, and every aspect of the gameplay, from resource gathering and base building to scientific research and exploration, feels authentic and believable.  The graphics and sound design are also top-notch, with stunning visuals and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that really immerses you in the game's world.

It struggled to run in 1440p on my RTX 3060ti. - The game felt sluggish (probably due to the framerate). - The look of the main character and the enemies in the game could be improved.

137934133,2368430,"This game is one big meh in terms of the TD genre.  It's near impossible to get through the levels, this is mainly because of the minibosses and the effects that towers do or don't have on them.  The game railroads you in choices that you need to make when starting the game. i.e. the only way to get through early rounds unscathed is by using AoE towers, take an arrow towers and you've already lost 2-6 health in the early waves because it literally can't keep up with the enemies in wave 1.  This also brings the ways to play this game all the way down. Slowing towers are needed to get through the midgame but, by the end, if you want to kill the boss you'll have to sell them for high single target damage towers, this is because the slow effect of the towers does not work . Now this would be fine, except you're making so little money (only on kills, nothing on wave end) that in the end when the boss spawns you've not even got enough to level up all your towers to max, this also means you don't have enough  money to sell and replace your slowing towers. This in turn can only mean that the only way you're getting past the boss is by buying the perfect tower.  Difficulty doesn't ramp up.  Animations are meh and often pointless. One of the bosses keeps casting spells that do something I guess? Except you have no idea what the spells do as the boss might just be throwing stones around that dont do anything, or he might spawn a magic circle beneath the feet that also... doesn't do anything? Some bosses do actually have some useful ""spells"" like the Golem that spawns minions.   Gonna give it  a negative review even as a free game as it feels more like an assignment than a game.",0

I cant say I understand the need for a main character if they specifically dont add anything to the game. (you could've done what many games do and have a faceless MC working from offscreen to manage everything).The town system is incredibly boring and has makes little sense either, you ouldve just had a clickable stat trainer menu and get the same effect. The dungeon aspect is the only thing that even needed some semblance of a background. And as for my crashing issue, apparently they were still relevant before this release, so THAT doesn't bode well. The game has alot of neat features, but also some confusingly pointless ones.  Edit: Sadly, I cant recommend it right now. The crashes are too frequent, and the game is virtually unplayable with them. I believe its something to do with the Autosave feature.",0

Specially on something you know is going to be this buggy on top of a huge time sink (freezes often). Occasionally some artifact thing that looks like a dart appears and follows you around. When you try to grab things it tosses the stuff all over the place. Don't fully understand the two shops selling blueprints. They seems to somewhat do the same thing. Maybe kinda. The saw didn't really upgrade until i did both of them. not sure what the plan was here. I thought originally maybe one was pure cash and the other resources. but the overlap doesn't make sense. The previous title the money was way to easy. This one appears to be on the complete opposite spectrum. Scrap metal goes for a bit more than this. The recycling mini game seems to be pretty pointless. I did like 1/2 the boat at one time and a perfect netting me like 4-5 bucks. If it's just for extra cash, there should be a autoshifter as the cash from it isn't worth it. The physics still need a good amount of work. You can clear almost the whole bottom without anything falling through. Just huge floors suspended in the air. Rivet work could be better.

137711383,2383190,"Love deckbuilders. Some good ideas but my goodness is the balance just wonky. Like one card costs 0 gives you a random attack but also gives you an action point. That's fine. Good trade-off of getting an action point for diluting my deck in a long fight. If it upgrades it gives you 3 attack cards to dilute your deck. So if you play a card that upgrades a card in hand you are just kinda praying it won't hit that card. Or there's a card that permanently lowers the cost of a random card in hand by 3 for the rest of the fight which is busted but if you upgrade it does it for two cards.  I suppose the last bit of wonkiness I saw was that you get to buy powers that you can unlock for your hero and then you get a random selection each run. One of the powers was heal for 2, another power was heal for 6. Why would you ever buy the heal for 2. It's cheaper but it dilutes all of your future runs. So just a lot of jank but if the price is right, I'd get the final game. Art is beautiful and I love jankiness in games just know what your getting into.",1

138125042,1321440,"Cassette Beasts is an interesting take on the mon genre (monre) that passes more often than it fails when it comes to presenting a cohesive experience.  Major disclaimer: this game might resemble a popular mon game series. This game, while borrowing elements of that series, is absolutely NOT like that game in the least. You will be mercilessly obliterated in your battles if you think it is. Prepare for shenanigans. We're entering romhacklike territory.  Pros: - Colorful monster designs are inspired and not at all derivative or overly generic (glances at temtem). You can definitely make out each monster's visual influences even when they're smushed together with other monsters, or evolved (""remixed""). - The sticker system presents an enormous amount of mix and match potential for almost any pick you go with. You might find yourself favoring other picks over your starter as more choices are made available to you. - No monster breeding means that you can just obtain one tape of any given monster and not have to endlessly fish for optimal stats or moves. (glances at temtem again) - You still have a reason to acquire more monster recordings because you can use extras for materials or fishing for more stickers. If you like collecting things, there's no shortage of hoarding here. - Gameplay is quite challenging. You will find yourself often on the back foot because new faces and gameplay elements can turn a situation on its head very quickly. On the other hand, you might just find a way past the problem just as quickly as things spiral out of control. Sometimes the problems are the solutions?... - Music, as a core theme of the game, is the game's strongest element and continues to impress at every turn, as long as you're into the aesthetic it is presenting. - The only thing that gates you off from advancing is the main story and unlocking new modes of overworld movement. Everything else is your choice as you see fit, no matter how reckless this is.  Cons: - The visual aesthetic is somewhat muddled, even given the context of the multiversal trash pile that the game world is set in. This makes it sometimes difficult for the theme of ""80's/90's americana I guess???"" to get across through these limitations. - The game somewhat suffers from romhack mechanical overload, which misses the point of the most popular mon's pick up and play style. (Of course, since this is a common problem to have, you mostly have yourself to blame if you go searching for somebody else's take on the monre.) This is somewhat alleviated by the fact that the game does take the time to explain new mechanics to you when they happen, but oftentimes you'll get bogged down in multiple pratfalls when some elemental matchups cause numerous status effects to pile up in a chain reaction that can feel somewhat discouraging when you get penalized two or three times by different things that happen from one mistake. Of course, it is somewhat evenhanded in that some mistakes can actually result in benefits for you, but all of this is happening by accident and makes the experience vary greatly between players for no other reason than luck of the draw from your previous choices. This can make counterplay and mitigation difficult to perform on the fly. - Having so many choices can easily lead to choice paralysis. This is even more of a problem if your monster has multiple evolution paths, and then on top of that we find out that stickers have rare variants that are better and have additional effects. Thankfully, given how flexible the game makes everything, if a choice doesn't work out, you're not super committed to it forever, or even in five minutes of resourceful thinking. - Materials are somewhat of a chore to farm early on until you get your footing, since most fights are never as simple as you think they would be, and there's no settings option to skip attack animations. - If you eat shit because you picked a fight a bit too big for your britches, you will lose a significant (to a new player) amount of resources, and then the game salts the wound by autosaving afterwards. It will also give you some healing items to help you, but if you went into a fight that killed you so fast you couldn't use them (action economy is extremely tight in most battles), it's somewhat unintentionally insulting, and you can't even hold them if you were already holding the maximum amount of healing items when you were wrecked. Although you can't lose anything that isn't replaceable, this can be extremely punishing to newer players who just wanted to see if they can beat a new challenge that they can only sort of guess how strong it is because enemy sprites are all roughly the same size in the overworld. Losses should have been scaled more towards relative player levels rather than a set percentage for the entire playthrough if the players are encouraged to take risks in a very off the rails experience, as there are no backsies if you fall down a hole filled with angry monsters or catch the attention of anybody dangerous. - Battles are somewhat skewed in favor of your opponent (romhack syndrome part two), because the assumption is that you know what you're doing, except you don't if you're going in blind. Yes, breaking them over your knee is easy once you do know what you're doing. May the fates help you if you don't though. - All of the above elements leads many players to have to consult the wiki in fear of putting their foot in a beartrap, which seems somewhat counter to the game's presentation of a wilderness where freedom is king. This is definitely not the kind of thing you can pick up casually, which leads me back to my original major point; most mon games seem to favor mechanical complexity over being easy to pick up, and it's weird that players and developers think that mainstream mons are overly simplistic and that being easy is a negative thing.  That being said, I can still recommend this game because they actually make this sort of design work for what they're shooting for, instead of being somewhat aimless like many romhacks. The design is tight enough that it can work with what its given, and that effort has largely paid off. The main thing you should be asking is if this kind of thing is your wheelhouse. Thankfully there's a demo for that.",1
138123673,1321440,"A fantastic, well-paced, and fun monster-tamer/battler that will create beautiful memories far beyond what any recent game in its genre has done in nearly 2 decades.   Please buy this game. It's worth every penny.",1
138122878,1321440,"Definitely pick up this game. And join us on the Discord too, the dev's are chill, even encouraging a new modding community. Can't overstate how much this is my new favourite game.",1
138121159,1321440,"One of the best games of 2023 by a long, long mile. Combat is interesting and unique, the dialogue is intriguing, the plot is thick, and the world is rich. Strategic planning is a necessary factor in the game, the capture system is mind, the mysteries are fascinating, and above all, the game has incredible graphics and a killer soundtrack. Customisation does lack a little in the clothing department, however, the ability to set your own pronouns, have the ability to wear a head scarf or face mask makes this game a stand-out amongst other monster-catchers. The game is, at no point, overtly difficult, or a cakewalk, and with tweakable difficulties and scaling, this game is incredibly user-friendly to any who wish to hop in and play. With an easy modding system, multiple save slots, and unique creatures, I severely misjudged just how complex and wonderful Cassette Beasts is. An easy 9/10 - my only critique being the somewhat dull Bootleg (this game's version of Shiny) hunting can be, even with late-game items.

138118598,1321440,Feels like it's trying to be an overly complicated Pokemon. Has some familiar elemental types BUT the way they interact with each other is not always how you would expect them to. And you better memorize all of them because there's no log to pull up to remind you what type interacts with which. They do remind you in combat what they do but it might be too late nor that helpful if you're looking to start with an advantage in battle.

137905799,1321440,仅代表个人观点，浅浅的打个分吧~  1. 游戏默认难度并不高，对于轻度玩家也非常友好。当然了，作为一款类POKEMON游戏，磁带怪兽的创新是非常出彩的。独特的融合系统，多属性闪光系统，技能无障碍搭配....都非常有趣！至少对我来说，一下子就失去了很多宝贵的碎觉时间......XD 不过值了值了~ 2. 收集方面有点自闭，因为按照数据来看，融合怪兽收集全简直是噩梦。本体怪兽120只也挺难收集全的，我主线做完大概收集了70%，剩下的都需要慢慢的收集。（这个地方有个短板，这里的怪物进化靠的升星但是没有什么简单的方法让低星的怪兽快速升星然后进化....不影响游玩，但是我这个收集控有点难受） 3. 主线和支线任务都很有趣，变态的赤膊大叔还总卖垃圾... 但是还是很好玩~至少我很喜欢它的任务系统，幽默有趣不枯燥~ 4. 解密是这个游戏的另一大亮点，有创意，很多精巧的机关会让我绞尽脑汁的对着宝箱无能狂怒... 虽然让我觉得我智商有问题，但是不得不说机关设计还是很有新意的~  总的来说·~ 8/10吧~ 再怎么说也是新游戏，中期解锁了子弹冲刺以后，如果操作太过顺滑（比如从最南边一路跑酷到最北边 lol 有传送点不用，非得自己跑酷的话），就会出现地图里怪物刷新不及时 然后游戏卡死（游戏的怪物是随进入地图以后生成的。快速通过多个地图会导致后台需要生成一大堆怪物，然后再一一消除进程..... 然后导致卡死.... 一定要随时存档lol~ 他自动存档也不错的，尽量别关）  推荐吧~,1
137905003,1321440,"If you are looking for a good-quality monster-capture-evolve-and-battle game, and you can accept that it doesn't have your favorite Pokemon in it, Cassette Beasts is a strong choice. For reference, the last Pokemon gen I played was Sun/Moon, and in comparison to the fairly linear formula those games presented, Cassette Beasts offers an open world with a variety of options to tackle at any time. There are companions to acquire with their own quests to pursue, captains to challenge (the equivalent of gym battles), unique hidden bosses (""Archangels"") you must find and confront, randomly spawning overworld super-monsters to fight (""Rogue fusions""), new abilities you can acquire to aid in traversal by capturing certain monsters, the ever-present drive to explore the map further, and to find and record new monsters.  I've heard that the most recent Pokemon games Scarlet/Violet go some distance towards presenting an open world similar to this, and having not played those games I can't directly compare, but I will say that this game suffers none of the performance problems I've heard riddle those games, and (IMO) the pixel art style used here offers a timeless style that I think will age far better than the current crop of 3D Pokemon games. Oh, and the soundtrack is great as well.  As potential points of detraction, I didn't find any of the companions particularly compelling as characters, especially those whose character arcs boil down to the cliche ""young person seeks meaning in life"". A more serious criticism is the post-game content - while there's a good amount available, it's extremely reliant on grinding to unlock currency. This seems like something that could be addressed in an patch, and I will update this review if this happens. While I consider this a serious drawback, one that has turned me off of the post-game barring some future update, I would like to be clear that this is only an issue for the post-game - I would still recommend this game for the ~25 hours of content it offers before the end.",1

137904063,1321440,"Besides Yo-Kai Watch, I never played a monster collecting game until Cassette Beasts and the aesthetic of the game just caught my overall attention. At first I thought the game not being necessarily linear was a bad thing as I felt I wasn't making progress, but after beating the game I realized how much it can make ones experience unique from others, and how you can progress however you want to and still make it to the end. The mechanics are simple but easy to understand, and I truly enjoy the soundtrack which was amazing. Overall I recommend it to anyone who likes sprite art or just rpgs in general.",1

137689777,1321440,"The soundtrack SLAPS. If you love the charm of Pokemon but find it lacks difficulty, or that the games lack much in the way of innovation, guys, Casette Beasts is for you.  The fusing of your beasts with your companion, the absolute audacity of the soundtrack being that banging and adapting to where you are, the many different elemental types and the ways in which they interact, the sToRyLiNe being both engaging and hilarious in equal measure (""Didn't you heavily imply they were vampires?"") - I could go on...  If you have any love for Pokemon-style collect and battle games but wished they had more challenge and you got to play as an actual adult, if you long for a truly innovative (yet still somewhat familiar) entry into this genre, stop waiting and buy this damn game already, won't you?",1

I have not finished this game yet, but holy moly i am so so so in LOVE with it. I love the monsters, the companions (especially Kayleigh <3) and THE SOUNDTRACK IS FANTASTIC. The initial draw was Traffikrab.   I came for Traffikrab and stayed for my absolute favorite indie game of 2023.",1

137685987,1321440,"Pretty fun game overall. Story is kind of basic, but a lot of cool mechanics. Definitely recommend if you're into creature collectors.",1
137685823,1321440,"Playtime: 20 hours for Credits, 45 hours for 95% completion (didn't feel like grinding out the last few achievements).   Cassette Beasts is a very fun take on creature collection RPGs. I enjoy a lot of the aesthetic aspects to it, but those are subjective and you can see them in the trailers or by trying the demo.  The mechanical differences between this and the obvious comparison of Pokemon are very compelling. Your beasts will learn more moves as they rank up, but these moves can be taken off of them and put onto your other beasts (as long as they're compatible), and moves can also be bought in shops to add a large amount of customization to your loadouts, especially when you get to the point where passive abilities can start playing a large role in your strategies.   Evolution (or Remastering as this game calls it) is very streamlined, once a beast reaches the maximum rank of 5 stars, resting will give you the chance to remaster it if it's capable of doing so. Many beasts have split-evolution paths, some of which simply give you the option when you remaster, and others have various hidden requirements that are hinted at in books you can find around the game world. Almost every end stage beast has the same stat total, with a handful a little lower and some particularly rare ones a little higher, so experimentation and picking your favorites is encouraged as opposed to simply finding the strongest monsters and using only them.  Aside from obtaining new monsters, leveling up your character, and gathering new moves, the game features two distinct classes of boss fights. There are ""Archangel"" bosses, creepy entities who seem to distort reality around them, presented in various different art styles and having unique battle mechanics that can't be replicated by the player. And there are also Ranger Captains, who use the same monsters you can obtain and fight using strategies that you can replicate or take inspiration from for your own builds. Both types of boss fights present their own forms of challenge, and having the two different types to bounce between helps keep up the variety.   Getting to the boss fights is also part of the fun. The game has a fixed map to explore and various exploration abilities to obtain by recording certain monsters. The Archangel bosses in particular tend to require solving some sort of exploration puzzle in the world in order to reveal their lair. The mechanics for this can sadly be a bit buggy at times, there's at least two known softlocks that can occur and require the use of cheats to escape from, but the overall charm and theming of the game help keep the bugginess from detracting from the overall experience.  After beating all of the bosses and completing the main story, there is a fair amount of post-game content to do, both obvious goals like completing the beastiary, as well as some light post-game story quests that involve new characters which help convey that the world will continue existing after you're done with it. And once you're done with all of that, there's extra game modes including a built-in randomizer you can use for spicing up an extra playthrough.   I don't usually take the time to call out music when doing a review, but I want to mention that this game has 7 distinct battle themes depending on the context of the fight, and all of them have a vocal variant for if you power up with Fusion during the battle, an excellent touch to emphasize the intensity.  Overall, cassette Beasts is a very enjoyable creature collection RPG that is well worth the asking price.",1
137684808,1321440,"Despite the obvious comparisons to Pokémon that might be drawn, the game plays and feels like its own thing completely. Delightful characters and monsters made me smile throughout, and the game's complete commitment to wearing its heart on its sleeve is to me, joyful.",1
137684311,1321440,"I wasn't expecting too much out of this game-- most monster catchers aren't anything special to me, and make me feel like I'd rather be playing what they're inspired by. But a halfhearted copycat this is not.  Cassette Beasts is very much it's own game, and it is a FANTASTIC experience at that. I've taken the time to fully immerse myself in the game world. Collecting new creatures, trying them out, and seeing who you gel with best is just plain fun. Whether you're like me and plan what guys you wanna use beforehand, or go in completely blind, this game has a little something for everyone.  The concept is so unique, and they follow through on the execution. Everything about it oozes charm. The party menu, health and experience bars included, being cassettes is just such a lovely touch. Not to mention, THE MUSIC. Every battle track in the game has two versions, and whenever you use the fusion mechanic that you can build up between fights, the lyrics KICK IN. It makes for an amazingly satisfying experience, especially when no fusion is barred from happening for arbitrary reason. Every monster can fuse with every other monster, making for over 14,000 different possible combinations.  All the beasts and the humans who turn into them are rendered in adorable high-quality 2d sprites, against a vibrant and expansive 3d environment. It's not unlike Octopath Traveler in that presentation department. Not to mention, you'll quickly find yourself growing close to the partner characters and their individual quests for something important to them. Meaning, justice, self-expression, memories...and each of them has their own signature monster not found anywhere else in the world. Aside from offering something valuable to a team, be it fast-paced blitzing or valuable supportive tools, you can even romance them if you get close enough...saucy.  In short, if you're a fan of monster tamers or not, you should 100% PLAY this game, it's such a joyous and enthralling experience. It makes learning the new type chart it has natural, easy to remember, and intuitive without being intrusive. Recording new monsters for your team is deeper, and far less annoying than the kind of catching you may be accustomed to. In fact, I'd go as far as to say it's FUN in of itself. The bosses are so creative, offer a fair challenge, and feel so good to defeat. The music goes so hard I'm going to purchase the soundtrack, which is something I like, never do for games. Supporting this game is entirely worth it, communities help a game thrive. And this one most certainly deserves it.",1
137683232,1321440,"This game rules in so many aspects. Amazing music, great artstyle, humor is on point, and battle mechanics are great!. Having a very good time playing this and theres so many nice touches that puts it over the top for me. Definitely a buy and I look forward to the future of this game/DLC hopefully!",1
137682609,1321440,"This game is like a magnificent mix between Jade Cocoon and Pokemon. It makes its own way, establishing different uses for status effects, elemental advantages, and gives you a nice collection of cool monsters to record.  It has a neat move system, world traversal abilities, and that old-school feel of areas you shouldn't have gone to yet, and your partner will warn you if you are in too high level an area. Fusions are neat, and if you combine the right monsters you become nigh invincible against even archangels. As far as I can tell you don't have to deal with EVs and IVs, and ""shinys,"" called bootlegs actually have some use because they are of a different type than the original. I haven't finished it yet, but I'm pretty sure in this game I will actually be able to catch 'em all. Overall the experience is enjoyable.   The problems: The game is either not properly optimized in general or for steam deck. Sometimes the game runs fine for hours, but with minor frame drops, and sometimes it frame drops all over the place, and then freezes. The frame drops cause problems with platforming also as they prevent you from gliding, and usually warp you to the ground.   Dialogue options are too easy to skip. I usually press the A button to open up the full dialogue to read it all at once. Dialogue choices appear at the end of a text box, and I have selected a choice at random several times by accidentally tapping the A button right as a short text box ends. I'm not sure if dialogue options actually matter, but it would still be better for them to appear by pressing the next button at the end of a sentence instead of automatically appearing.  Your partner has a tendency to get in the way.  Some overworld dialogue is misleading: There is one point where you are told to use the climbing power to get across a wall. You actually have to glide and then use the climbing power otherwise you fall off too early.  Some character quests are arduous slogs and take half the game to complete, others you find toward the end of the game and can complete their quest in minutes.",1

137793197,2193090,"There are a few minor annoyances I have with Witch Rise mainly stemming from the lackluster map but overall the game is really solid and I didn’t notice a single bug throughout my 100% playthrough.   My main issue with the in-game map is that there aren’t any markers for rooms that have stuff like bosses or shops so if you aren’t keeping track of where everything is located you can really get lost backtracking in circles. I understand that there are a few hidden chest rooms but once I find a shop or important room it should be marked. Honestly in a way the game feels like it’s more of a puzzle solving escape maze than anything.   In terms of enemies and traps there is a surprising amount of variety to be found here with several different types of attacks and patterns. While there is a bit of repetition in a few of the enemy designs later on, they all have different attack patterns and more health so they don’t feel too samey. The bosses are fairly unique and interesting compared to the normal enemies but the only one that I died to a single time was the green orb guardian because it caught me off guard.  The Music & Sound design is another strong point about the game though there are a few things without sounds that I wish had them (fire traps for one). But the sound effects themselves are really satisfying and fitting. The music tracks can get a bit repetitive if you get lost in one area for a long time but each section of the map has its own track which helps a ton.   Ultimately I’ll say that the game was quite short for me, only about 90 minutes even going out of my way to 100% (level 20 achievement took an extra like ~15 minutes alone) but it’s a fairly unique experience and for only $5 I would say that it’s worth it.",1

138083242,1293460,"[h1] Less of a card game, more of a puzzle game. [/h1]  TL:DR The gameplay is more about figuring out what you need than to build a strong deck and run with it. Gameplay is engaging and rewarding. The plot is pretty good if you can get around the main character's, Finn's, voice.  [b] First, the plot. [/b] You, Finn, and your crew of three others travel into enemy territory to participate in the war games tournies, hoping to find a way to remove army leaders. The whole time throughout the game, you get to listen to voice acted visual novel sections. The worst part of these visual novel sections is how Finn sounds. No matter what he's talking about, he always sounds exactly the same. There was a part early on where Finn was talking about how much he hates the Frisians for killing his parents and it sounded like a regular Tuesday to him. If you were to suggest that, maybe, Finn is meant to sound casual about everything, the text for each line includes a tone indicator just to inform you of the intention.   Once I was accepting of Finn, I was actually hooked. While the plot (and game for that matter) is linear, you do have the option of how you want to go about stopping the war, with the choices being unlocked by the gameplay. I thoroughly loved how the leaders interacted with Finn and his party. I loved the interparty dynamics. It was just fantastic.   [b] Next, the gameplay [/b] Quick gameplay summary for those who don't know how the game works. You bring two decks into combat. One consists of 10 minions and the other is 10 support cards (such as equipment and spells). Starting hand is three each, you draw one more of each turn, and you can play one of each per turn. Minions will move towards the enemy side until they can hit something.  The rules above are simple but the complexities are great.  As you progress through the game, you will unlock assess to 4 different deck types. The first two is Berkanan and Bandit.  The Berkanan are all around units. Many of them have built in survival effects.  How about a minion who gains armor (damage reduction) every time he gets an equipment? Or a swordswoman who gains attack every turn? Or a minion that heals all of your minions? If you want good attack and defense, the Berkanans are your friends. Overall, this group were my favorite, as the versatility of their kit and overall tankyness for the end game were perfect for me.  The second deck is the bandits. While they might seem like they are more aggressive than the Berkanans (which they are initially), the bandits are more about breaking the rules. Minions with poisonous and equipment that grant it, minions that summon an extra copy of itself when you play it, or spells that deal damage to a minion based on the amount of bandits you control. If you needed something tricky, the bandits are your people.   The next deck you unlock is the Frisian deck. Have you ever wanted to hit end turn an insane amount of times without actually doing anything to win? Are you a blue control player in MTG? The Frisians are the most defensive people. They have high health, high armor, and low attack. However, they win the game through draining the enemy hero's health. Most of their minions increase this drain amount. Unless this deck was intended as the solution, I usually avoided this deck due to how slowly it plays. It would take a good 5 or 10 turns of passing once I actually know that I'm in a winning position.  Lastly, we have the Gellians who were the hyper aggressive deck. Their minions move fast, deal a lot of damage, have low health, and hurt you each round they're alive. Honestly, it seemed really good in fights with few enemy minions. I had a hard mission beaten in two or three turns because I had a double attacker buffed to with a +13 attack equipment. It's a strong deck, but I feel like it falls off rather quickly, due to how the game gets harder.  With the decks out of the way, what do I mean by ""more of a puzzle game""  Well, the actual gameplay is going through sets of challenges, where the rules change each time. One fight will have both sides starting with all of their minions on the battlefield. Another fight will place barricades in the way. Each time you'll need to consider the fight and find out what you need to use. To use that example of starting with all the minions on the battlefield, there's an obvious answer. The Frisian deck (the control one) whole weakness is the slow start up. By having all of your minions on the field instantly, the whole fight is trivial once you figure it out. Even the hard version of the stage is easily dealt with. Most of the game (past the first tournament) is trying to find out what is going to happen and planning a way around it.   One of the biggest issues I have with the game is how much effort goes into remaking a deck. When you want to make a new deck the steps are as follows: 1) Refund all of your upgrade points and your gold 2) Assemble the deck you want 3) Click on each of the 20 cards separately and click upgrade anywhere between 0-4 times  If you don't know what you're doing, you may have to remake the deck more than once per fight, and it takes a while.  So, let's talk about the difficulty real fast. You start each tournament by fighting the basic version of each fight, You can try it as many times as you need, as you just need to beat it somehow. After that, you'll unlock a hard mode, which asks you to beat each fight again, but with additional rules. You only have a limited number of tries for each of the hard mode fights (including the boss fights). I was initially upset with this, as a card game's heavy RNG could make sure you never get a good run. However, due to the puzzle nature, once you have the appropriate deck, I never needed more than 2 tries. Therefore, I really think that this is a great way to have a difficulty option for those who want it.  Lastly, the mechanic I felt like was wasted. You can also change what hero you are using. The only difference between them is what ability they have on a three turn cool down. Do you want a +3 attack until end of turn for 1 character? Heal a unit to full heal but you lose that much health? Use a second support card this turn? Or bring back 1 minion that died this game (once per fight)? And that's it. That's all of them. They play very similarly, as there's no difference in health or tribe. There's almost no long term impact in the fight. The option for different heroes could have been great, but we were left with a very safe option. I really didn't end up using them much, but it was nice to have a +3 attack when I really needed it (not often). I feel like this could have been very expanded but oh well.  Overall, I enjoyed this game. It wasn't that hard but did require thought throughout.  I hope to see more single player card games on the market that have great story, great looks, and great plot like this one.",1
138032769,1293460,"One of the best strategy games I've played in a long while. Just finished my first play through, and seriously considered clicking new game. I feel like I haven't been this absorbed with a game since Monster Train. very impressed!",1
138032262,1293460,Fun,1
138028216,1293460,"Fantastic game, I really enjoyed my first play through.  The team is very focused on making changes based on community feedback even when game has already been finished.  Quite challenging, but not frustrating so very good balance.  I can't seem to beat the final boss, it's quite a long multi-stage fight, I'll keep trying!",1
138014846,1293460,"In short, yes I recommend this game if: 1. You played Ash of Gods: Redemption & liked it (how couldn't you; it was a masterpiece) 2. You enjoy strategic turn-based tactical RPGs with an emphasis on clever tactics that punish mistakes 3. You enjoy beautiful hand drawn graphics that compliment the plot and characters 4. You're tired of P2W Mobile-style tactical RPGs that are really for the whales rather than the tactical aficionado  TLDR: Quality passion project based on turn-based tactical RPG with an emphasis on Puzzle solving, deck-building, & character skill-tree paradigm.",1
138011997,1293460,Great tactics game. Also really made me appreciate how much of a difference a little plot context makes in pulling you on through the game. Engaging characters with every line voice acted. About as good a production value as you could ask for from a AA title.  It can be hard to keep a game like this fresh without bogging it down in unnecessarily fiddly mechanics. Ash of Gods excels by making every single battle unique in its objectives and circumstances. So it combines steady progression of your tools with asking you to constantly find new ways to apply them.,1
138007608,1293460,"The game is good to very good.  It could even be excellent, but I haven't played a whole lot yet, and I've heard that later missions get really, really difficult.  We'll see.  I just wanted to post a quick positive review to help the developers out.  They are a good bunch of folks, and have made a really special and enjoyable game.",1
137929853,1293460,"I would definitely recommend this game for people who like Deckbuilders/Auto-battlers. I had a lot of fun and also a bit of a challenge playing it.  The game took around 20 hours to complete on normal for a semi-experienced player with deckbuilders with all fights finished (even the extra challenges).   Positives: - Clever way of presenting the battle concept throughout the game (very immersive at least for me) - Animations are good - Big variety of cards, 4 (5 but the last doesn't give you faction cards) completely different factions and cool trinkets (oh how I would have liked even more variety :D) - The challenges are thoughtfully crafted which adds to the experience and makes you think of different ways to play the game - I liked the characters from the story but would say that the dialogue could be improved. In my opinion this game would be an instant classic if the story itself was a bit deeper. - The art style is spot on. - game mechanics are great especially poison (simple but keeps the gameplay interesting, also Gell characters are frustrating (in a good way) as hell)  What can be improved (some of the points are for future games) - as said about the dialogue could have been a bit better but probably the most confusing part was the the one with the Gells' chieftain (just saw that work has been done on it). - Would have loved a deeper story as the game play is absolutely great - Deck management was a bit annoying for me. Probably a better switching between the decks could make it better. - A fight log would have been extremely helpful as the lastly played things shown wasn't enough for me - a bit more variety for Commanders  Solid 8.5/10 in my book",1
137864376,1293460,"""I am blown away by the depth and complexity of this game. The storyline is gripping and kept me engaged throughout the entire game. The characters are unique and well-developed, and I found myself getting emotionally invested in their fates. The tactical combat is challenging yet satisfying, and I loved the ability to customize my characters' abilities and gear. The graphics and sound design are top-notch, and the dark fantasy world of the game is beautifully realized. Overall, ""Ash of Gods: The Way"" is an absolute gem of a game, and I highly recommend it to any fans of RPGs and dark fantasy. Well done AurumDust Studio!""",1
138105024,1575830,"[h1] try the demo to check if you will enjoy [/h1]  The game runs well on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton. On Deck, you can get a steady 60 FPS with a power draw of 15W by using the low graphics preset, and on ultra I got an average of 30FPS with a power draw of 25W. Medium with a few tweaks hit the sweat spot for me.  ArcRunner gives you many options of playstyle with multiple weapons, gadgets and characters, but only a few choices were useful. It has some qualities of life I enjoyed: [list]     [*]Information you need, like the energy, ammo and number of dashes are represented close to the aim reticle.     [*]You can stop the game at any time, and when you come back you will start after the last arena you completed, instead of having to restart the whole run or a level     [*]The hit detection was local, so when I played with friends from far away, we did not have to deal with latency problems [/list] The roguelike mechanics feel shoehorned, kind of way to force a stall in your progress in the game. The grind was not different from an RPG that locks your progress behind a boss, and you need to Sisyphus the area before until you have enough experience to defeat it. By the time you reach world 3, the world 1 that was once challenging and fun becomes just a chore as you are over level for those enemies. The game has an air of unfinished, some augmentations at the end of each level only say, ""skills level 1, level 2, and so on"".  The dev team has been busy balancing the game, making more options of equipment viable for your run, tweaking characters and fixing bugs. When you read this, many things will have changed, so I recommend you to try the demo, and see if it is something you will enjoy.

138103327,1575830,"It's fun. Slow to start but after a couple of deaths/runs, you hit a nice pacing.",1
138076943,1575830,"I'm really not sure where to even start with this one. I'd say the game is fun *for a while*, but has some fundamental design failings.   For a roguelite, it offers very limited variety. There are only three playable classes, one of which takes a considerable amount of time to unlock. Many weapons are redundant or just plain bad, and a handful are so completely overpowered that there's no reason for the rest of the arsenal to exist. For having to unlock the ability to carry heavy weapons, and them requiring special ammo Mass Effect-style, they're really, really underwhelming. You can unlock upgrade slots for your weapons, but the upgrades are mostly trivial with a few exceptions, and heavy weapons don't even get upgrades, making them even worse. Weapons you get are also tied to certain regions that you progress through linearly. Using a weapon enough allows you to get it at the start of your run, which when you combine that with the linear metaprogression, means that the first areas become trivial time-wasters. Roguelites with metaprogression need floor skip options, otherwise you end up in a situation where you're just enduring the tedium of early levels, and playing with a friend doesn't help that stay entertaining, it just results in two+ bored players. To make matters worse, dropped weapons and equipment have no power progression (mostly) meaning that once you find the gear item and start with the weapon you want, you can safely ignore any further dropped gear as its stats do not improve in any practical matter. All that *does* matter is the upgrades you pick at the end of each floor, and while they are beneficial, they're sufficiently bland, not offering up much beyond stat increases with only a handful of exceptions. So you've got a roguelite game where the runs vary on only the most minute level, except for the metaprogression, which is remarkably disinteresting.  When I mentioned before that there are only three playable classes, I've only played with one of them despite going through the game twice, once on normal and once on hard. The Ninja is absolutely overpowered in solo because the AI weren't coded to deal with a lone player going invisible. This is very confusing considering there are only three classes, and only two available at the start. I know it's highly insulting to say this, but did the devs really not playtest their game? It doesn't take much to figure out that the AI completely (and I mean completely) breaks down in the face of no visible players. What's worse is that it's very clear that there's minimal difficulty scaling besides enemy damage and health. Some enemies are obnoxiously hard to deal with, but I never really get the feeling of something new being thrown at me, just different flavors of the same thing. Nothing gets me to change my approach, just the method I use to avoid getting hit (which is usually tapping invisibility on for a half second because that breaks the AI). There are some ""challenge"" events which do not at all scale up their challenges besides switching over to hard mode which is the most laughably pathetic attempt at difficulty scaling I've seen. Multi-kill 5 enemies becomes 7 enemies. 10 melee kills becomes 13 melee kills. Fucking riveting.  It astonishes me that it took a post-release patch for them to make the player movement not completely terrible, instead upping things to just slightly terrible. For a game with ""runner"" in the title, you move remarkably slow, even after the patch to speed you up. You can get used to the controls, but I say ""get used to"" similarly to how you get used to the controls of something like Space Engineers. This is great when enemies and the environment start using AoE attacks which are *sometimes* telegraphed with a visible circle on the ground, but sometimes the circle is bugged and doesn't appear on certain surfaces. Sometimes the circle is fucking lying, and you get hit with the AoE when you're very clearly outside of it. On that note, you could probably call this location ""Red Barrel City"" with the number of things that outright explode when you damage them slightly.  The music is okay, perfectly fitting, but there's absolutely not enough variety to avoid getting repetitive. I suggest listening to each track once or twice, then subbing in your own music. The sound design is okay, though as a sound designer myself, I recognize a lot of the samples they used.  The visual style is quite nice, though many enemy designs tend to blend into the background, and it's unclear if that was intentional or not. Though I will comment that they made the ninja's face mask suspiciously similar to that of Jack's from Ghostrunner.  The story is not why you're here. It's basic, it's boring, it's just barely enough context for what it is that you're doing.  None of the problems I mentioned until now are even remotely as bad as the fact that finishing the game resets all of your metaprogression. I thought I read in a patch that they changed it so this no longer happens, but sure enough my things were all reset after beating it on hard. So to that end, I absolutely cannot recommend this game at the price they're charging. If you're curious, maybe wait for a -75% sale.",0

138028670,2360030,"It's a very short and simple game that does leave you wanting more than what it offers. While it's set on a different location and theme it really does feel like a expansion for the second game which isn't a bad thing but the game does end before it can really begin.  Now one big criticism that I'm sure a lot can agree is the abundance of misspells, grammar errors, and more in the games text which while funny at times (for the wrong reasons) it's really bad that all of that was left in like that.  I don't wanna call this game bad but more so it's just really mediocre that while I'm sure big fans of 3d platformers could enjoy this, I think your better off maybe just getting the kao reboot game instead",0
137825469,2360030,Kao Mystery of Volcano never played it when it was released this here on steam is my first time playing it and i didnt expect much but its really a mid game only but even it feels sometimes kinda like an unfinsihed game:  Pros: + some short fun level design is there like the last map was the best the rest sadly is only mid + the soundtracks even its only few are kinda alright + the glider move is ok + change of day and night is a neat thing in this game  Cons: - respective soundtrack there are almost no variety - graphics even for 2005 are kinda mid the lighting in night-time is bad - mini games like racing arent as fun as Kao 1 and 2 - final boss was kinda boring - enemie hitboxes feels weird sometimes - the inside temple place where you have to hid as a chest this part is bad atleast for me was not fun at all the worst part of the game - movement/controls are kinda worse than Kao 2 - no steam freatures like Achievements and Steam Cloud  Very short game 2-4 hours if you want to 100% it. Still i would say you can give it a try even it feels like a test game for a proper Kao 3 (feels like Kao 2.5 spinoff game or addon for Kao 2).,0
137748890,2360030,"I bought this game together with the re-release of the first one, but I have to say that even though I can recommend the first Kao game then this one is a pass for me. It wouldn't really be the case if the game was exactly as the old release (even though You can really feel that this game is worse then the previous ones), but it appears that there are new bugs that were not present in the original release (the old ones are also still present),   The main menu doesn't show the progress of Your current save, the voiceover from polish version is gone and there's none in the english version (don't know if there was any voiceover in english version, I played the original version in polish) and, on top of that, all of english dialogues are just really poorly written.. This should really be the bare minimum to at least change the english dialogues to be correct, without gramatical mistakes and nonsense.  That being said it's still worth noting that the previous two games are just simply better overall; I'd recommend playing them and skipping this one.",0

138129043,1623940,Bramble: The Mountain King was an unexpected and beautiful creepy story. I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end and was not expecting to like it as much as I did.,1
138125487,1623940,"I honestly really loved this game, and it's been a while since I've played something that stood out this much to me.   Bramble has its flaws as most games do, I personally found the camera a little wonky and sometimes managed to jump at weird angles to my death with no help from the forest creatures. I also had a couple problems with the game crashing/bugging out initially (I played on steam deck), but after the most recent update it plays great on the deck!  If anything I wish I could have roamed around in this fairytale world longer, even with all the monsters out to chomp on me. While not the best graphics I've seen in recent years, everything was beautifully designed, which carries more weight in my opinion. There is a strange harmony between the lovely scenes filled with light and friendly forest creatures and those filled with blood and fear, like a dream that slips into a nightmare. I think these days you can tell when a game is made with heart or just pushed out for the sake of consumption, and Bramble really has a soul of its own.  If you want to experience a dark fairytale in a world filled with everything magical and horrifying, check this game out. The story is relatively simple and short, but gives you lots of peeks into something deeper, darker, and even more terribly beautiful.  Now excuse me while I go purchase the soundtrack because it is incredible.  Side note: skogsrå's magic works on women too, cause I'm smitten",1

A wild adventure tugging you between feeling excitement to dread, fearing what you will come upon next and yet not being able to look away. The story is so interesting to me and I love the Scandinavian fables/myths that are apart of this game. The music is at times breathtaking and other times haunting, complimenting the scenes you come upon perfectly. I truly enjoyed this game and was sad once the adventure came to an end.",1
138026113,1623940,"This was a lot of fun. Great narrator, incredible visuals, amusing characters. The feel of scale really comes through nicely, and the entire thing sets up like an absolute cinematic gem. It is really setup to let you enjoy the story while still having a few adrenaline moments.

No spoilers, but you'll know the point when you can choose your ending. It'll be around 3-4 hours in, depending on your play-style. Battles got a little repetitive, especially in the final dungeon. Pro-tip for future developers, if you set it so the characters heal at level-up, make sure you've given us a way to replace that once we max out. I had to skip chests in the last area because I didn't have enough SP replenishment items to waste. Still, an overall good time was spent playing. I am worried about the other 3 endings though....",1

Full of innovations (AlienGPT, sectors, combat system, core world/colonies, etc.) that makes the game depth really good and satisfying. There's a lot to learn and experience here if you're willing to dive into it.   The amount of care and work put in by the devs every week is exceptional. I've never seen this level of interaction with the player base from any other game. If you like to test out new ideas in an ever evolving game, this early access is for you.

If you prefer a fully finished product that doesn't change much from patch to patch, hold on for the moment and wait for the full release.  P.S. Special thanks to Stardock for allowing its Epic players to transfer their game to Steam. Again, another example of how exceptional these guys and gals are.",1
138121350,1824580,"Really cool premise and a ton of fun! I love deckbuilders and this certainly scratches that itch. Also includes some nice little side missions to accomplish and minigames that you can play. You get used to the deckbuilding UI but I do agree that it's not the most intuitive. Some rules are unclear, like how playing a card will also trigger its discard effect (since it is played and then discarded to the graveyard). Overall, I'd highly recommend the game.  I will note that I've had one softlock so far when playing, but thankfully it was in the hub and I didn't lose any progress.",1
138099761,1824580,This game definitely gets my recommendation based off how well designed the combat is. Every card seems useful in some way (at least for now) and all the enemies are designed like a puzzle to be figured out.  There are an unfortunate amount of caveats however as this game is currently lacking a significant amount of polish. Masters won't tell you that they have a reward for you once you've collected enough cards. Nor will they have a quest marker right after you've completed their most recent quest. There's no good indicators to know which NPCs are shop vendors without talking to everyone in town. You can't preview the different book cosmetics without buying them. You can't rename decks. Changing out rune slots is tedious. So on and so forth.  There's a great game here with good visuals and music and a rewarding gameplay loop that has clearly been put together with a lot of care. It's just you have to put up with a fair amount of things that'll hopefully be properly ironed out soon.,1
138068068,1824580,"[h2]This is an informative review not really negative[/h2] This game stands out visually in a big way. The pixel animations, numerous layers of visual effects, and even the mini-games are all done very well. However, the primary game play is a tad bit weak, and the ""re-shuffle"" concept is a touch bothersome if you're too familiar with auto-shuffle games.   My first reaction was in short ""This looks amazing!""  My biggest complaint is that there are several issues in both the game play and the graphical UI. Most importantly, if you're attempting to set up a new deck, it's honestly simply a mess to do it in a nice and orderly manner, because you can't search for a card's name if you're looking for it. You must manually search for the style or by hovering over the many cards acquired.  It would be wise to perhaps come back to this title in a few months, if and when these issues get addressed.   [h2]Conclusion[/h2] I liked it, but it needs some polish as it feels too much like an Early Access title right now.   Feels like a mixture of old-school turn based combat, with a mixture of cards that can only be shuffled after stepping on a re-shuffle stone. This means you have to basically think a bit more strategically else you will run out of cards and have no way of actually continuing until you find the place to re-shuffle. Really fun fishing mini-game that could honestly be it's own thing. The base camp could use a mini-map or something. It's sometimes difficult to navigate.",0
138062939,1824580,"I like this game quite a lot; it's a nice mix of all my favourite genres! As others have mentioned, it does have a few bugs the devs are working on ironing out. Nothing completely game breaking on my end, but it could fustrate some users.",1
138021709,1824580,"Very fun and exciting take on the genre. Combat is satisfying, the hub world is super interesting, the characters/art/aesthetic is charming, and there are plenty of alternate game modes and mini games to keep things fresh. Very MtG inspired, it would seem. Highly recommend.",1

137993366,1824580,"Great combination of a deck builder roguelight with a tactical grid combat spin to it and wonderful pixel art animations.  Combat is super fun, deckbuilding and card mechanics are really interesting with many options. I love how the game is a long campaign where you slowly build your card collection by going into randomly generated dungeons, where you have to push your luck, after each floor you can go back to the town and open your booster packs, or keep going to harder floors for better booster packs, but if you die you loose all your loot.  The deckbuilding UI is hard to manage and I hate that I can't rename or delete my decks, it's a shame beacause there are many deck ideas I want to try!! I also wished you could save the game while in a dungeon, I get that it part of the roguelight aspects of the game is to avoid save scumming, but if it's a single file anyway shouldn't matter if I save inside the dungeon. Still it's a great game and I hope the devs keep adding to it",1
137960391,1824580,"This is my first review, but I really felt the need to do one for this game. While the game concept is really good and the mechanics and different cards are fun, this game is highly frustrating. This is due to its many bugs - you spend ours in one run just to reach the final boss and the game crashes, so you have to restart the game. This happened to me frequently on one of 3 bosses so far where I had to restart the game 6 times, consuming a lot of time and energy, and it´s also incredibly frustrating when you´re on the verge of winning. While fighting the next boss the game fortunately didn´t crash, however when I went back to the starting room after defeating the boss to check whether the star room opened or not, the boss room door was closed again, without there being a boss of course. So I had to quit the game again and start over...  If you have enough money that you don´t know what to spend on and are immune to frustration, this game is for you. But paying 25€ for a game that constantly bugs and crashes is not something I´d recommend to friends.",0
137953269,1824580,it has minor bugs and ux issues but a good game.,1
137896873,1824580,"Fantastic game. Real fun and challenging at first. After some grinding for cards, it gets real easy but the Archetype masters give you some further challenge later in the game (though some quests are easier than others). I really only played 3 of the 5 Archetypes (Oracle, Raider, and Stranger) but that's just because those ones interested me but I can see how any of the Archetypes would be fun to play with.  My only complaints:  1.) (Quality of Life) When you unlock the ability to convert start packs to gold packs, you have to do it one at a time. I wish you could bundle it/mass convert the starter packs.  2.) Being able to changer your character to one of the other start characters or have some other character customization other than just changing your tome color.",1

138072668,1974250,It's not a bad game. Goes through a story of a depressed man who slowly changes to being positive. Puzzles are entertaining enough to solve through. Prefer the early puzzles rather than the orbiting word searching puzzles. They use your brain more and sometimes the camera needs to be at the exact angle to recognize it. Down side to this is it's quick and some what buggy at times. The most out of this is probably 3 hours and that's if you're stuck at one of the puzzles. I have encountered some crashes but solved it by turning everything down to the minimal. It's the few cringes I have at the game. If you can get this game on a deal and don't know if there's anything else to grab and this game is the only thing that interest you then get it. I had my fun out of it.,1

138128040,1869590,"One of the most fun multiplayer games I have picked up in the past few years. The skillfloor is low enough so that everyone can have a go since the standard game mechanics are easy to understand and there arent too many of them. But executing them and playing around your opponents and teammates needs practice and skill which you both develope rather quickly. So gameplaywise a game anyone can pick up and sink their teeth into. The ""items"" you get/choose to passively modify some of your abilities also put depth, personalization and creativity into the gameplay.  Things you can buy in the shop are purely cosmetic: there are character skins, emotes and ""emoji"" (most of them are based on known memes which makes them fun for me) as well as nameplates, profileicons etc. From what I have seen they are all very high quality. The battle pass has some of them for free but to get all, you have to buy it. For this game I did and I do not regret it.  Unlockwise I would even argue that the speed in which you unlock new characters is quite fast. That way you can easilly try out most of them in just a few hours of playing, allowing you to see which ones you like best. And there are plenty to choose from and all of them play differently, even if their main skill (hitting the ball) is the same.  The community isnt very toxic - mainly because there is only emoji chat. There are still some smaller issues in this game but the developers work on them and they are communicating them well via video. All in all a great game to play which has room to improve even more.",1

138125358,1869590,Good game,1
138125261,1869590,"I would give this game an overwhelmingly positive review if possible, and that's even though I have some issues with the game as well. I'm writing this after the game's first micro patch announcement where they talk about what they want to fix as well, so here's the good and bad.  *GOOD* The game is free, so try it, it's VERY fun. It's very likely my favorite competitive free-to-game that I've played in years, and it's REAL addictive. Matches are short (sometimes very short), and even playing a best of 5 in Normal or Competitive comes and goes within about 10 minutes. The controls take a little bit of time to learn based on who you're playing, but you can pick this up incredibly fast as most abilities are straight-forward. The online community in-game is fairly kind, with lots of thumbs up and pogs when you score, and I've even seen the other team cheer us on during the closer games. The art style is incredibly cohesive and has a solid identity and vibe, and the opening animation by Trigger really sells the feel of this game and the personality of the characters. Finally, the devs seem cool! During the first announcement for what they plan to fix, I kept saying ""THANK YOU"" to every talking point, meaning they have been incredibly proactive so far in listening to the community and are doing what they can to make this game good, and seem to have ears on the ground for what changes to make. I'm more used to the free-to-play market being more focused on in-game transaction pushes rather than community feedback, so this is really nice. In terms of in-game purchases, I'm weak and spent $20 on some cute skins, but I don't feel like it's pushed at all. I love that I'm unlocking other characters by just playing the game a lot, and I'm able to unlock a new character every couple of days of playing or so, which means I don't see myself ever needing to pay to play the whole roster if I didn't wanted to. Also, the cosmetics are very cute, which goes back to how banger the art team is with this game. I wanna see this game grow a lot, and I'm shocked there's been no fanart of these character yet, and really wanna see a small community grow here.  *BAD* On the smaller level of bad, I'm still a little lost on some of the game's terminology. They actually have an in-game glossary of the game's lingo and mechanics, and while that's great it still leaves out a lot of terms. For example, I have zero idea what Spark is or what it does. I looked in the glossary, thought I paid attention in the tutorial, and while I could google what it means maybe, I shouldn't have to and things like that should really be explained better. The lack of a practice/training mode makes this harder, because it means you sorta need to throw a game or two in order to learn how a new character works, which isn't fun for your teammates. Finally, the worst part of the game: AFK and players dropping from games. It happens a strange amount, and even in Overwatch or Fortnite I never see the amount of AFK instances like I see in this game. You can't do anything about it either, if your teammate stops moving or leaves entirely, you're forced to play that best of 5 anyways knowing you're going to lose. There isn't a penalty or ban for dropping like this either. And, on the off chance you have that dog in you and decide you wanna quit too because a teammate dropped, you can't just close out the game and reboot it because surprise: when you restart the game, it will open and force you back into that same game, meaning you have to wait to play again until it's over. While I wouldn't recommend ever DQing from any online team game, the fact of the matter is that this is the game at it's least fun. Just today it happened so often that I just played a different game because I was sick of losing rank in competitive just because a teammate decided to dip.   Luckily, the devs have addressed the lack of a practice mode, AFK, and drop outs in the micro patch update, and are at least working on it. They even said they are planning to add a forfeit feature, which is ABSOLUTELY needed, although I hope you don't lose rank for forfeiting if you're doing it because you're down a player. If anything, while it's irritating, I almost wish the game would just automatically call the match a draw when there's a player down, but that's just me. I severely hope they can fix this issue because this problem is almost frequent and bad enough that it almost ruins the entire experience of the game, which isn't fair because 90% of the time otherwise it's fantastic. Overall, the game is absolutely worth picking up and trying, and if the devs manage to give penalties or bans to the players who are making the game a bad experience, I think this game has amazing potential, and is still fun all the same.",1

138050800,1869590,"I played the game a decent amount during beta. During this time, my experience with this game was exhilarating. Matches were fast paced and could get nail-bitingly close. This created an extremely fun and addicting game play loop. Beta was a 9/10  Not that the game is out, I feel like the game has slowed down. The item system they added feels more like an auto chess item system and it gives no definition to how a player really wants to play their character. Having 3, 2 out of 3 matches feels a but unnecessary and makes games take much longer than they should. I really liked the game before and I never thought twice about playing it but now I have a hard time queing up because the pacing of the game is much, much worse.  I appreciate the devs trying to redefine the equipment system. Tbh the beta one was a bit 1 dimensional and lack-luster to say the least, but it seems that the way they implemented those changes really slowed down the pace of a game and the excitement I personaly get from it.  Please Devs, revert to the old game system and figure out a better way to do items.",1

137944668,1869590,"Omega Strikers is a really fun game with unique concept of being half airhockey half PvP brawler and there's no product similar to it. However, there's a ""nuances"".  Some of them because of matchmaking.   1. Did you think that League of Leagends leavers are bad? Try this game.  Leaving leavers aside, there's even worst issue, that's ""probably"" will never be adressed.  2. There's no separation of solo Q and full premade Q in this game, so prepare to be ROFLSTOMPED a lot by coordinated teams while you stuck with 2 randoms who installed this game 10 minutes ago. This applies to all game modes.  3. There's no way to increase pacing if you get a leaver, so you just stuck there for another 4-7 minutes.   4. Character balance is not in the best spot, maybe you may like Juno (Slime Girl), but she's pretty much permabanned in Competitive and rightfuly so, she's broken in a lot of aspects. Not only she can solo combo/pass by herself, but in order to remove her slimes from the field you need to step on them and that alone gives her A LOT OF FREE damage without any effort. That's why she's banned most of the time. I'd say banrate at around 90+% or so.   Out of 30+ competitive games i've played i've seen her only 2 times and that's because the voting system for bans here is kinda vonky, because if 2 players vote for one and another vote for different char it will be 66/33% chance of the ban. I.e. all 3 must pick one char for 100% ban.  5. Another example is also ""X"" or Elvis. What this guy does is extremely simple and straightforward and can dish an insane amount of damage and knockdowns without any effort on the player part due to how his skills work. Probably the strongest character for the forward role.  TL;DR For me playing against full stack/premade as solo player (mostly) is absolutely disgusting no matter if quick play or competitive, but that's only my opinion. Feel free to try the game, though. The core gameplay concept is really good.",1

Turn em off. Bad at combat? One hit those baddies. Good at combat? Let them one hit you. I liked that it was more puzzle focused than I was expecting.   I would say the only complaint I really had was that the audio was difficult to keep balanced, my weapon was much louder than the other sound effects and the volume during boss encounters could get to be a bit much.  as far as bugs, I maybe glitched into place a few times or found my way into places I wasn't supposed to be but really I had a pretty bug free experience.

138120012,1607240,"It's a fun relaxing game about exploration and platforming. However, there are several bugs in a few places that need to be fixed including one that makes 100% of the game impossible and while you can still beat the game you're unable to complete it. I can recommend it as the devs said they have more fixes on the way soon.",1
138118001,1607240,"Mail time is an adorable game! I love the character customization and the designs of the other characters is incredibly charming. I laughed at the dialogue quite a bit, since it appealed to my humour, and also found myself feeling uplifted by a monologue by a certain character at the end. For spoiler reasons, I won't say what the message is (you'll just have to play it to  find out!), but it came to me at a very difficult time and was really comforting to hear. I also really enjoy how casual the LGBT+ representation is. As part of that community myself, I am a bit tired of my only rep being negative or overtly sexual in nature. It was also nice to have they/them pronouns be an option as well! Not something I see everyday.  There are some bugs, and from reading previous forum posts there were bugged achievements. I managed to get 100%, so it IS possible to get them all, though I had to start a new game for one in particular, which required a delivery under 30 seconds. However, this took basically no time at all.   I did come across some bugs where a mushroom-gathering quest was considered complete, but my inventory still had items and the last two hats were locked for me. Also I had to go find my mentor near the end of the story and it skipped directly from where I was to finding her at the end of the game. Not game-breaking, but still a bit disappointing. However, the dev team is responsive to bug reports and clearly trying their hardest to get patches out as quickly as possible with their small team. A lot of love was put into this game and it shows.  My biggest complaint about the game? It's not long enough! I was just so enamoured with the environments and characters that I was so sad when I realized I had completed the game. I'm not sure what could be added, really, aside from new towns and characters, perhaps with different abilities you can gain as you deliver more and more letters. Another idea could be expanding on some of the lore within Grumblewood (like the mysterious well voice, who I tried so badly to get more info on, but found nothing. Unless a storyline is present already and I just couldn't find the trigger for it).   Overall, this game was thoroughly enjoyable and I hope to see more like it in the future! Definitely recommend it.",1

138096122,1607240,"While it's indeed quite wholesome and charming, as indicated by the cutesy forest aesthetic and whimsical creatures, Mail Time is not afraid to tackle deeper themes and subjects like mental health (anxiety, depression), capitalism (a literal fat cat!), and more. There is a criticism that can be made for ""wholesome"" games that trade on cuteness and positive vibes but might not have much meaningful to say. But thankfully Mail Time is deeper than that in the storytelling department. It's because of this and it being a 3D platformed and a mail delivery game that reminded me of Lake and A Short Hike. It's frequently funny too, and the characters are well written with arcs to them. I particularly liked the artist raven and the racing turtle's struggles with perfectionism. It's also similarly short, at 3 hours. I also appreciate the level of customisation and inclusivity on display. An easy game to recommend and could end up as one of my GOTY contenders!",1
138078805,1607240,"First off I will say that if you enjoy a game where you run back and forth then this is great and I did enjoy the play personally but I constantly ran into different bugs. I found myself stuck in terrain quite a few times and had to use the un-stuck button over and over again. My biggest issues by far was a bug after every text interaction caused the mouse to become unbound from the window and sadly my normal fix for such an issue (alt+tab and tab back in) did not fix this, the only solution was to leave the game entirely and return. I found myself VERY aggravated but too stubborn to not complete the game cause it was 15$ (on sale and not even worth that price in my opinion) and I would have preferred spending that money else where but I was stupidly stubborn.   My last complaint would be about the subversive elements that did not need to be there. I'm not calling for gamer-gate 2.0,  but suffice to say, it was gross and would have ruined the game for me even with out the bugs, pronouns and gender ambiguity were heavily addressed and hard to ignore as they were CONSTANTLY  throw in your face, I do understand that this is a growing theme nowadays but it was OVERLY asserted and far too unnecessary.  Over all I am disappointed but I suppose I am not surprised.",0

The game starts off pretty basic with 7 story lines focusing on individual characters but bare with me. I wont spoil it but it improves greatly after that. Although the experiece isnt really long in comparison to Octopath (This game being only about 20 to 30 hours unless you're a completionist), the game nails the story line and the turn based RPG elements that we've grown ever so accustomed to. it was a great experience.",1

138035305,2014380,"A legendary classic, with terrific updated graphics and music. I quibble with their need to redo all the game's formulas without really surfacing what they are, especially when so many of the damage formulas are *very* obscure and confusing, but considering number go up = damage go up and the original was even more obtuse, it's hard to complain. And Megalomania really is that hype. I personally recommend pulling out a guide once you hit the final chapter, but that's just my opinion.",1

138000127,2014380,"Excellent remake/port showing all the other subpar ports out there how it's done. Having never played or really heard about Live A Live I went in blind and I'm better off for it. The only suggestion I might make is looking up which chapters to start with as some of the chapters can be more story heavy and may not be the best introduction.  The performance is stellar even on potato laptop hardware, the sprite art is amazing, and the 2d/3d effects have really been mastered looking at Octopath 2 and Live a Live.  Highly recommended for any JRPG fans or newbies alike.",1
137974873,2014380,"I never knew I needed a remake of an obscure little rpg from Square's back catalog, but I'm so glad they made it! It's bizarre, it's tight, it has humor, it has feels, it doesn't overstay its welcome, it's never boring and it's just a perfect vertical slice of what Square used to be. We need more quality stuff like this.",1
137969945,2014380,"A beautiful JRPG.  There are seven different narratives each with its own main character that employs varying gimmicks, and mechanics unavailable to the other chapters.  Each story brings something unique to the table, and while as a player we might not enjoy all of them there will at least be one that you will like.  The soundtrack is incredible.  Entire game is decently voice acted.  Most chapters can be completed within 1-3 hours then there are some additional unlocks after completing them all which will extend play time as well.  The overall game isn't incredibly long nor short.  A 100% achievement completion run with a guide can take around 25 hours which I think is a reasonable length that avoids the pitfalls of ""too short"" or ""too long"" completion runs.  By the end of everything I didn't feel burned out which is a huge positive especially in comparison to other JRPG's.  Combat system is neat, but doesn't carry a lot of strategic depth which isn't necessarily a bad thing considering how new chapters means a brand new set of characters/equipment/stats.  This is a title that is more narrative focused than gameplay.  I definitely will recommend to anyone who is a fan of turned based JRPG's.  The way everything is tied together at the end is incredible, and the journey is certainly worth it.",1
137963728,2014380,"The definitive example of what a remaster should be: giving a game that never got a chance to truly shine a second chance at success, while also keeping intact all the things that made the original players love it in the first place.

Depending on the ratio of good to bad endings you get, this will ultimately affect your ending with him as well.   I thoroughly enjoyed all the different aesthetics.  Each piece fully feels like its own thing, and I had fun figuring out all the puzzles.  I even loved the psychiatrist's creepy laugh.  lol Everything looked great, sounded great, ran great.

137742919,2344820,"Puzzle Wizards is pretty fun so far.  I've got probably 15 hours in it between Steam and mobile.  It's still very much early access, but they're taking feedback and making changes.  The art and animations are charming and the music catchy.  The mini dungeons with their little environmental puzzles are fun.  There's a nice variety of different takes on the match-3 puzzle format. The game unfortunately doesn't capture the magic of Puzzle Pirates.  Part of is probably the influence of making sure the game is mobile friendly from the beginning, which limits the kind of puzzle variety that works.  For instance there's no falling block puzzles, which are my personal favorite sub-genre. Part of is probably the setting.  A sailing ship already has the concept of different roles built-in.  When you're wizarding around in a dungeon with other people, you can do different things, such as having one person clearing a blocked door while another extracts a puzzle piece from a pedastal, or people doing the same thing, such joining a battle or a mix boss together.  But the feeling of people doing completely different roles, simultaneously, together, is different.  If that makes any sense.  Part of it may just be the timing.  YPP came out when the landscape of internet gaming was very different.  That said, I'm having fun with the game, and see myself continuing to do so for a good while yet.",1

I have no idea how it got on my wishlist but am super glad it did. I feel bad for this game; it seemed to pass its launch week without getting enough reviews to generate a score, which would've helped it gain more exposure. I blame the developer self-publishing, the very generic title, the surprise release and the lack of a launch discount. Aside from this, I agree with the review that says this game is very friendly to speedrunning.

The restriction on island building is actually the most annoying thing in the world. It goes from super fast pace build build build get bigger yes yes let's go to FULL STOP. Now grind you B*TCH.

They already released several balancing patches to fix some of the grindiness, and I'm really excited to see what more the devs add to the game in the future, especially considering they seem to be listening to community feedback very quickly (7 patches that address the feedback in as many days after launch!). I'm not entirely sure I would recommend the game for 16$, since it doesn't feel like there's enough content for that, but this is early access and considering I personally would value the game at 10$, it's not like that's a big difference in value.  Gameplay: You have your sky island and the buildings on it are what give you skill stats. You pretty much just wander the 'continent', which is procedurally generated and has I believe 6-8 biomes, and is also littered with dungeons and crystals (which trigger boss fights). There are 3 enemy difficulty tiers, yellow, cyan, and magenta, and drop their corresponding gems. You can also find residents in dungeons or by defeating monsters (the residents are just friendly versions of the monsters) and having them on your island give you bonuses for that monster type. It's a fun enough gameplay loop but doesn't offer a lot of depth, though it is very cute and aesthetically pleasing, and unlocking new furniture by discovering them in dungeons is fun. Combat is decent, not complicated but fun enough to not be boring either.",1

Regardless, on a review of the actual game, I love it. I haven't completed all the side quests, exploration and other shenanigans and extra boss fights about. It'll be one I replay in future for sure. Plus, to Respawns credit, they are releasing patches practically every other day to try help those suffering from performance. Oh, which graphically, even with all my settings on the lowest, looks stunning. Wonder how goo it would look if I had a fully fledged PC! For me, it was worth the pre-order, yet for those looking for a more casual go through the game, or even just the story, obviously I think a price drop would round it out as a top tier buy, but £60 is the modern new game world unfortunately.",1

Now the gameplay: The combat is basically the same as the last game with the parries and timing your attacks but this time around they have added 3 more new lightsaber stances that all have different play styles. BD-1 has also got some new abilities to use to get an advantage against enemies. The parkour is also the same as the last game but with new abilities to navigate the HUGE worlds. I'm not kidding when I say that one of the planets is bigger than Dathomir and Zeffo from Fallen Order. I was noticing frame drops when the game first came out but I believe that was patched in the latest update but I don't know about other people so I can't really say much on that matter.

They definitely should have emphasized side content, they definitely should have emphasized the other jobs, ""rumors"", and side quests, and they definitely should have invested more heavily in different planets and environments and experiences that were available as well as ones that weren't available. This game definitely should have been twice as big as it was... i'm not going to lie.... I'm literally sitting here with my spouse in the hospital after a severe car accident, and typing out this review.  Something about a car wreck and the prospect of your husband never being able to walk, or talk, or think, or make decisions for himself ever again...definitely makes one second-guess how one spends their time--and with whom, and which activities, one spends it doing. I will say that this game is probably the most fun Star Wars game I've ever played, and has a better more unique feel and story than many other Star Wars based games. Admittedly it also served as a welcome reprieve from the stress and depression that recent life events have brought me. I will definitely say it is a good game-nay, a great game!

138088329,1774580,"TLDR: Great gameplay marred by lack of optimisation. Buy on Sale if you can wait. First game I ever noticed a very possible ""VRAM leak""  Pros: 1. This is the only sequel I know which took into consideration ""skills"" gained in the first game instead of mysteriously having to ""re-learn"" the skills again. This creates great immersion 2. Settings that changes game play somewhat moving it either closer to Souls or Force Unleashed depending on your settings. This imo is awesome 3. Addition of side quests is nice  Cons: 1. Lack of optimisations causing horrible performance on all settings. I've even noticed at the cantina that my GPU is eating up 21GB of VRAM whereas if I booted the game up at the cantina save point, it's around 6GB. Something somewhere isn't letting go of VRAM. Also many locales are not using GPU power much causing stupid slowdowns for no good reason. I can understand if slowdowns or lags are due to my hardware being insufficient but caused by not fully using my hardware is ridiculous 2. Deluxe version is a total ripoff. I wasn't reading properly when I purchased it but basically its 2 skins. I should've paid more attention when purchasing 3. Random freezes that requires a hard reboot. Can't even get to taskmgr to kill it off",1
138088008,1774580,One of the best game in SW universe. If your system can run it. I was fortunate and ran almost flawless on mine so I could enjoy the story.,1
138087827,1774580,"I think overall its a yes from me, but there are plenty of flaws.  Game ran perfectly fine for me, with only 2 crashes in the entire 55 hours it took to platinum it. Overall it was good, combat for the most part was always enjoyable and plenty to explore.  Story wise however it was quite divisive for me, the dialogue and interactions between your friends and around the main hub area was some of the best ive experienced. However almost the entire villian side was conversely some of...if not the worst I have ever seen. I think Rayvis was the only decent one of the 3 main ones, with the 1st/2nd act main villain being super cringe. But the worst offender is the 3rd act, its just diabolically bad.",1
138087693,1774580,"Lag is bad but still bearable, but crashes? Go fuck yourself EA. Grinded for 30 minutes to beat a hard force tear, one crash and its all gone. 3090 5900x btw",0
138086784,1774580,"Buggy buggy buggy, even after the patch. I have the PC version and it just keeps crashing and/or freezing. Rig is high end and plays all AAA titles in 4K ultra setting with no probs what-so-ever. Not this game. Ran file validation which said 300+ files failed to validate and would need to redownload the game, only for Steam to say disk read error. Good grief. Running validation again and if it happens again, will uninstall the game a wait a bit to see if it all gets fixed.",0
138086761,1774580,story is verry good,1
138086541,1774580,The game itself is great.  But it badly needs optimization and stability.,1
138060983,1774580,"Fun game for the 1st world where it would actually run. Then it would crash about 2 mins after startup like clockwork. Updated my drivers and somehow made it worse, it still crashes 2 mins in but now the graphics look totally deep fried and like im playing on the lowest settings in 720p while I wait for the eventual crash.   10/10 would crash again",0
138060973,1774580,"Performance is shit, but every other aspect is great.",1
138060948,1774580,I wouldnt say this game is shit but right now it is and cant even play past the jedah first crate then my game freezes spent 100$ for another EA game expecting a different outcome but you cant trust EA with these games anymore sadly.,1
138060860,1774580,the game itself is great but it runs terribly freezes nonstop and textures never render correctly cut scenes are almost impossible to get through should wait till its fixed,0
138060625,1774580,tar wars,1
138060579,1774580,"I know a lot of people are having performance issues, but it was mostly fine for me. It stuttered a bit while moving between areas too fast and I doubt I consistently got more than 40 fps, but it was perfectly playable for me.   Everything else about the game is amazing though. The game play is great, the story is great, it's all just great.   All in all, an amazing game that I thoroughly enjoyed. However, if you are concerned by the reports of frequent crashes and game breaking bugs, you might to play it safe and wait a few months to pick this one up. Also, if you care a bunch about high fps, this one probably isn't going to do it for you, even after they patch it up.",1
138060303,1774580,"very good game overall,one crash ,fps could be better but didnt expect much with r5 3600,3060rtx in first place 8.5/10 i would welcome some forest/frost maps and kotor like quest but one can only dream",1
138060181,1774580,Crashes way to much,0
